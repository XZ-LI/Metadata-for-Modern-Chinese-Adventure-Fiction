stronger mine mr clifford stared him no wonder benita wont let mesmerize her said shortly jacob saw mistake you foolish thought said how could mesmerize without knowing it laughing you i didnt see laugh replied mr clifford uneasily went lesson afternoon put proofin cave itself meyer seemed think influence would propitious benita found amusement performance seated upon stone step underneath crucifix one lamp altar others one side her front stood father staring waving hand mysteriously obedience jacobs directions ridiculous look indeed thus engaged benita greatest difficulty preventing bursting laughter effect grimace gesticulation produced upon her although outwardly kept solemn appearance even time time shut eye encourage him once opened again perceive becoming hot exhausted jacob watching unpleasant intentness reclosed eye might see face shortly sudden benita feel something kind penetrating power flowing upon her something soft subtle seemed creep brain like sound mothers lullaby dim year ago began think lost traveller among alpine snow wrapped round snow falling falling ten myriad flakes every one little heart fire came heard snowsleep dangerous last sleeps victim must rouse themselves die benita roused timeonly just borne edge precipice upon wing swans beneath darkness wherein dim figure walked lamp heart be oh heavy eyelids surely weight hung them golden weight there there open saw father ceased efforts rubbing brow red pockethandkerchief behind him rigid arm outstretched glowing eye fastened face stood jacob meyer effort sprang feet shaking head dog does have done nonsense said it tire me snatching one lamp ran swiftly place benita expected jacob meyer would angry her braced scene nothing sort happened afterwards saw two approaching engaged apparently amicable talk mr meyer say mesmerist love said father and quite believe him weary job tired escape matabele laughed answered to judge result agree you occult line father better give up did you then feel nothing asked meyer nothing all answered looking eyes no thats wrong felt extremely bored sorry see father making ridiculous grey hair nonsense sort dont go well together no answered i agree younot sort subject dropped next days intense relief benita heard mesmerism begin with something else occupy minds matabele tired marching round fortress singing endless warsongs determined upon assault point vantage topmost wall three could watch preparation made tree cut brought great distance rude ladder might fashioned them also spy wandered round reconnoitring weak place defences came near makalanga fired them killing some retreated camp made fold ground little distance suddenly occurred meyer although matabele safe makalanga bullets commanded greater eminence way recreation set harass them rifle sporting martini ample supply ammunition moreover beautiful marksman sight like hawk trial shot gave range shade seven hundred yards began operations lying top wall resting rifle upon stone waited man superintending manufacture ladder came open when aiming carefully fired soldier whitebearded savage sprang air fell backwards companion stared upwards wondering whence bullet come pretty wasnt it said meyer benita watching pair fieldglasses i dare say answered but dont want see more giving glass father climbed wall meyer stayed there time time heard report rifle evening told killed six men wounded ten more adding best days shooting could remember what use many asked not much answered but annoys amuses me also part bargain help makalanga attacked i believe like killing people said i dont mind it miss clifford especially tried kill you xviii benita irregular times nothing else do jacob went manshooting mr clifford joined him though le effect soon became evident matabele much annoyed fatal accuracy fire loss life mind abstract none knew turn might come next perish beneath downward plunging bullets matter wore different face them leave camp easy since made thorn boma round it protect case makalanga make night sally also could find convenient spot upshot hurry assault delivered prepared sufficient ladder make effective first break dawn third day mr cliffords attempt mesmerism benita awakened sound shout firing dressed hastily hurried growing light towards part wall noise seemed come climbing it found father jacob already seated there rifle hand the fool attacking small gate went riding miss clifford worst place could chosen although wall look weak there said latter if makalanga pluck ought teach lesson sun rose saw company matabele carried ladder hands rushing onwards morning mist till sight obstructed swell hill company two white men opened fire result could see light presently great shout announced enemy gained fosse setting ladders time makalanga appeared done nothing began fire rapidly ancient bastion commanded entrance impi striving storm soon thinning fog perceived wounded matabele staggering crawling back towards camp these light better jacob neglect take toll meanwhile ancient fortress rang hideous tumult attack evident again fierce warshouts proclaimed matabele striving scale wall beaten back raking rifle fire triumphant yell seemed announce success fire slackened benita grew pale fear the makalanga coward bolting muttered mr clifford listening terrible anxiety courage came back them presently gun cracked louder incessant before savage cry kill kill kill dwindled died away another five minute matabele full retreat bearing many dead wounded men upon back stretched ladders our makalanga friend grateful u hundred rifles said jacob loaded fired rapidly sending bullet wherever cluster thickest had throat would cut now added for could never stopped savage spear yes nightfall said benita shudder sight desperate fray fear might end sickened her thank heaven over perhaps give siege go away but notwithstanding costly defeat lost hundred men matabele afraid return buluwayo except victors nothing sort cut quantity reed scrub moved camp nearly bank river placing position could longer searched fire two white men sat sullenly hoping starve garrison find way entering fortress meyers shooting come end lack men shoot at since enemy exposed more able give full attention matter treasure hunt nothing could found cave devoted outside enclosure which may remembered grown grass tree crowded ruins important ruin began dig somewhat aimlessly rewarded finding certain amount gold shape bead ornaments skeleton ancients portuguese hoard sign thus came grew gloomier day day till last scarcely spoke other jacobs angry disappointment written face benita filled despair since escape gaoler matabele seemed impossible moreover another cause anxiety illhealth threatening father long fell upon earnest sudden became old man strength energy left him mind filled remorse held crime bringing daughter awful place terror fate threatened her could think nothing else vain try comfort him would wring hand groan praying god would forgive him now too meyers mastery became continually evident mr clifford implored man almost tears unblock wall allow go makalanga even tried bribe offer share treasure found failed property transvaal jacob told roughly fool see thing together would go brood himself benita noticed always took rifle pistol him evidently feared lest father catch unprepared take law hand mean sudden bullet one comfort had however although watched closely jew never tried molest way even enigmatic amorous speeches degrees indeed came believe gone mind abandoned advance hopeless week passed since matabele attack nothing happened makalanga took notice them far aware old molimo never attempted climb blocked wall otherwise communicate them thing strange that knowing affection her benita
