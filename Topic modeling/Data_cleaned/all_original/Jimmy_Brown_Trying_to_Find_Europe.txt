JIMMY BROWN TRYING TO FIND EUROPE
I
THE reason why my pen has so long been silent in the grave, as the clergyman said last week about the editor of a newspaper who died from the effect of a subscriber whom he had written something nice about, and who invited him to dinner and fed him on so much meat that the editor, not being used to it, had a dreadful pain, and the doctors couldn’t do anything for him, though the apothecary accidentally sent him four times as much medicine as the doctors ordered, is that I have been to Europe and had no time to write. You have no idea how much time it takes to go to Europe, especially when you don’t know exactly where it is, and when you do get there and your father says, “ Now, Jimmy, you don’t stir out of my sight again, not for five minutes; you understand me,” how can a boy write ?

The way I came to go to Europe is what I am now going to tell. It is a long story, but I am going to write it in the hope that it may do good and lead other boys into the right path, which is more expensive than the way I went, but a great deal more comfortable.
To begin at the beginning. A year ago, very nearly, my sister Sue and Mr. Travers were married. I never believed they would be, they had been so long about it, but one day mother said, “ We might go to Europe this winter if we only had Susan off our hands/’ and father said, “ My dear, that is just what I want to do, and I’m going to make Travers understand it.” I don’t know what he did, but a month afterwards Sue was actually married in the big front room, and I had a tremendous big piece of cake, and it didn’t make me sick, though the baby came near dying. Of course I wouldn’t have given the baby any of my littlest sister’s piece of cake if I had supposed it would have done any harm, but what can you expect of a baby, anyhow?
We had a little accident at the wedding, and I think that it was one reason why Mr. Travers afterwards became cool to me. Every one knows that when people are married you throw rice and shoes at their heads for good luck. I don’t believe in it myself. Of course you can’t pretend to have any luck unless you hit them with your 2

shoe or your rice, and if you do hit them I don’t think it brings you much luck, especially if you have to go and live with them afterwards, as I did.
When I found that things were to be thrown at Sue and Mr. Travers, I thought I would throw something of more consequence than the little old slipper that mother meant to throw. It is all very well for a woman to throw a little thing like that, for they haven’t any strength, and don’t know how to throw, but a man is expected to do better. There was a big old india-rubber boot in the garret, which weighed about twenty pounds. I went up into the garret every day for nearly two weeks, and practised throwing this boot at a mark. I made a splendid invention, too. Instead of throwing the boot and the rice separately, I filled the boot full of rice, and then threw it with a sort of circular motion. It would whiz through the air, with a stream of rice coming out of it, just as fire comes out of a fireworks when it is first lit and moves slowly, and then, when the boot struck the mark, it would seem just to burst into rice. I practised with this invention till I could hit the mark every time, and I felt sure that if there was any luck in throwing things at married people I couldn’t fail to get it.
The morning of the wedding I loaded up the boot, and took it down-stairs and hid it under a bush by the front 3

gate. The wedding came off all right. Sue made Mr. Travers come to the house and sleep in my room the night before, “ Because you’ll be sure to oversleep yourself and be late and it will be perfectly awful.” So he was there in time, and Sue had on a beautiful dress, but her shoes must have hurt her, for she cried like anything as soon as she was married; but she was as obstinate as ever, and when I said, “ Sue, let me take your shoes off. I told you this morning they would hurt you, but you wouldn’t listen, and now you see I was right,” she wouldn’t even speak to me. I was sorry for her, for she ought to have felt so happy that she was married at last after trying for so many years, but I sometimes think it is a waste of time to be sorry for girls. Of course you can’t help feeling sorry when anybody is a girl, for it is a dreadful misfortune; for she can never play ball, or go in swimming, or shoot off a cannon, or do anything else that is really worth doing; but it is of no use to make yourself miserable every time a girl cries, for almost always she cries about some little thing that you would never think of. I remember once how Sue cried because I brought her down her back hair one Sunday evening when Mr. Travers had come to go to church with her, and she was so much excited that she forgot all about her back hair, and came down to see Mr. Travers without

it Now you would suppose that she would have been so pleased to think that I remembered it, and cared enough for her to go upstairs and get it without waiting to be told; but she wasn’t. Let us be kind to girls and pity their misfortunes, but let us remember that they are different from us, and that we can never understand them.
After the wedding we had a beautiful dinner. Sue would call it “breakfast,” though it was after twelve o’clock and we had had breakfast already. And then, too, who ever heard of a breakfast with ice-cream! I don’t mean to say that ice-cream wouldn’t be a good thing for breakfast, but I never heard of anybody who had it.
Everybody made speeches at dinner. That is, father did, and the rector did, and Mr; Travers did, and so did the young man who stood up with Mr. Travers at the wedding to see fair play. This young man—I suppose he was the umpire, though I don’t remember his name— made a real nice speech, and said that he hoped that his venerable friend who sat opposite to him, and who, he understood, had never been married, would be encouraged to go and do likewise. The “venerable friend,” as the umpire called him, was Mr. Martin, who everybody knew had been trying to marry Sue for the last twenty 5

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe years. He was awfully angry, and used language about the umpire after everybody else had gone home. But that’s always the way with an umpire. No matter what he may do, people will find fault with him. We had a great game of ball in our town one day between our club and one from the next town, and it was months before the umpire could leave his bed.
I wanted to make a speech myself, but when I said so to Mr. Travers, who sat near me, he kicked me under the table in a low tone and said, “ You keep quiet unless you want to die.” That was very rude, but Mr. Travers began to change the very day he was married; even before I threw the boot.
After a while all the dinner was eaten up, and the carriage came to the front door, and Sue cried over father and mother, and my littlest sister and the baby and me, and said to Mr. Martin, “ You must throw some rice after me or I shall feel ever so bad.” Then we all went out to the carriage except me, who went down to the gate where I had the boot handy, and everybody had something ready to throw except the clergyman, who had the rheumatism and an extra plate of ice-cream, and sat in a big chair. The moment the carriage started they all threw their rice and slippers, but nobody was hit except the umpire, who gave an awful yell because Mr.

Martin hit him accidentally in the face with a handful of rice, and afterwards explained that owing to his cork leg he could never throw anything straight.
I waited till everybody else had thrown, because I did not want to have the effect of my invention spoiled by a lot of ridiculous little slippers. I threw my boot just as Mr. Travers stood up in the carriage to wave good-by. You ought to have seen how that boot sailed through the air with the rice flying in every direction. It hit Mr. Travers directly in the face, and knocked him backward out of the carriage, and filled Sue’s eyes full of rice and frightened everybody half to death.
I was awfully frightened myself, for I was afraid Mr. Travers was killed, but before I could get to him he picked himself up and twisted the pieces of his coat around him, and climbed into the carriage and drove off without saying a word. As I afterwards heard, Sue wasn’t really hurt, and only had to wear a bandage over one eye for a few weeks. Mr. Travers’s clothes were pretty well torn up, and he fell on his hat when he struck the ground; but unless you count his nose, which the driver of the carriage said was so swelled up that you could hardly see his face, he was not hurt at all. Still, both he and Sue might have been seriously injured, though I never dreamed when I threw the boot that it
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe would do any harm. Indeed, I thought every one would be pleased and would say: “Well done, Jimmy! What an ingenious boy that is! He’ll invent a steam-engine some day—see if he doesn’t.”
Instead of this, what they did say to me was very unkind, though I don’t say that I didn’t deserve it; for nobody has any right to knock a man out of a carriage, even if he is just married. I nearly forgot to say, however, that Mr. Martin was real kind to me. While father was telling the clergyman that he was afraid his son had been too much excited by the wedding, and that although his conduct had been undoubtedly such he had not intended to do any harm, Mr. Martin came up to me and slipped a silver dollar into my hand, and told me that if ever the umpire was married and I would go to the wedding he would give me five dollars. I never knew before that Mr. Martin was such a good, kind man. I really wish he, instead of Mr. Travers, had married Sue.
I was very much surprised that father did not ask me to go upstairs with him after the people had gone home, but he didn’t, and he said very little to me about the accident to Mr. Travers, though I heard him say to mother that if Mr. Travers had been married when he ought to have been Jimmy would have been too young to throw a heavy boot. Father never did like it that Sue

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe and Mr. Travers were engaged to be married for ten years. He used to say that people who couldn’t make up their minds to be married ought not to wear out other people’s furniture. I think he wanted Sue to marry his old friend Mr. Martin, but she wouldn’t listen to it.
I should never have been obliged to go to Europe if Sue had married Mr. Martin. I didn’t like him when I was young, and no wonder, for he used to rumple my hair and call me “ Bub,” which is a thing that no living man has a right to do, and how would he like to have it done to himself. And then he had a cork leg and a glass eye and a wig, and was always coming apart and blaming me for it. But now that I have found out how it changes a man to get married, I am sure that Mr. Martin would have been real nice if he had married Sue. Almost any change would have improved him, and if he had improved only half as much as Mr. Travers didn’t improve, I could have lived happily with him.
It is a curious thing that though it changes a man to get married it doesn’t change a girl at all. The Gentile reader—as books always say, though I don’t see why they don’t sometimes say “ the Jew reader ” too—will see how Mr. Travers was entirely spoilt by being married, but Sue was always just the same, or even more so. Now a

MR. TRAVERS had told me mornamillion times that, after he should be married to Sue, I was to come and live with him. Sue heard him say it lots of times, for I remember she always used to say: “ Pshaw! don’t be perfectly ridiculous. I’d like to catch myself living within a hundred miles of that boy after I leave this house.” So it was all perfectly understood, and I never dreamed for a minute that Mr. Travers wasn’t in earnest, and I had always found him so nice that I was anxious to live with him. He and Sue were to live at West Thompsonville, and I was surprised that they didn’t ask me to go with them the day they were married.
A few weeks after the wedding, father had made all his arrangements for going to Europe. He and mother and the baby and my littlest sister were to go, and the house was to be shut up, and I was to go and stay with Mr. Travers for a year, and go to school in West Thompsonville. Mr. Travers wrote that, “ I will meet your son at the station next Tuesday and take charge of him 11

while you are gone, at the rate proposed, though I will not answer for the consequences, as Susan is in a nervous state, and I do not think her system requires boys.” I copied this from his letter, because I wanted to ask him what he meant by “ the consequences,” but I forgot to do it.
The day before father and mother started, I was sent to Mr. Travers’s with a trunk of my own, and a lot of new clothes, and a beautiful young bull-dog that Mr. Martin gave me for a parting present, and was so modest about it that he made me promise that I wouldn’t tell any one who had given it to me. The dog was in a box with holes in it, and he growled elegantly every time anybody touched the box. I took him out as soon as the train started, and the first thing he did was to take a splendid big piece out of the leg of my trousers. Then he sat up on the seat and growled till the conductor came along and said: “Boy, whose dog is that? No dogs allowed here. You must put him back into that box, and be quick about it. Tickets, gentlemen, if you please.” But I told him that I didn’t think the dog wanted to go back, and I was afraid it would make trouble if anybody tried to make him change his mind. The conductor said that he didn’t care what the dog wanted, but that he was going back into that box inside of three seconds, or he’d
12

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe know the reason why. So he tried to take him by the scruff of the neck, but the dog was too quick for him, and after taking a little piece out of his hand, jumped down and hid under the seat. The conductor called a brakesman, and the two together began to hunt the dog.
If the dog had been willing to keep quiet, they wouldn’t have found him, but he was a little angry himself at the way he was treated, and I don’t blame him, for nobody likes to be poked with sticks, and told to come here you brute, and get out of that now will you. So every little while he would take hold of somebody’s leg, and you would hear a dreadful yell, and would know just where the dog was; but by the time the conductor and the brakesman could get there, the dog would have got through with that particular leg, and would be in another part of the car selecting another leg. But after a while they chased him down to the door, which was open, and drove him out on the platform, and the brakesman would have pushed him off the train, only he didn’t dare to do it.
Very soon afterwards we arrived at West Thompsonville, and there the dog let me pick him up and carry him. The passengers growled more than the dog did, and some of those who had been bitten said that I ought to be killed, and the dog sent to jail, but I never pay much

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe attention to what angry people say, they are so unreasonable. Mr. Travers met me at the station, and said: “ Oh I it’s you, is it ? Come along! Where did that brute come from?” This wasn’t a very nice welcome, but I didn’t mind that, for presently he said: “ That dog looks sick, Jimmy. We’ll step into the apothecary’s and get a dose of medicine for him.” This was just as kind as it could be, and I had a hundred times rather a man should be kind to my dog than kind to me; that is, of course, if he can’t be both.
The dog was pretty sick, though I hadn’t noticed it, for he died that night. When we went into the apothecary’s, Mr. Travers said to the young man behind the counter: “William, I think this dog is in a pretty bad way. He looks pale. Don’t you think a little strychnine would do him good?” The young man said: “Yes, strychnine is a beautiful medicine for that kind of a dog. I’ll put you up some.” So he gave Mr. Travers a powder, and he put it in his pocket, and we came away. I said to Mr. Travers that if the medicine was real good I should like to take some, for I felt a little pale myself; but he said, “ Jimmy, I am sure it would do you and your friends all the good in the world, and nothing would make me happier than to give the whole of it to you, but it’s against the law for me to give medicine to anybody, and 14
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe you must promise me never to taste the least bit of this kind of medicine while you’re here.” Of course I promised him, because he spoke so kind. His kindness, however, did not last very long.
Mr. Travers had a beautiful house, with lots of horses, and cows, and crows. There was a lovely crow’s nest on the top of a tree close to the barn, and I could hardly wait till I could get a chance to climb for it. Sue was glad to see me, and said: " So they did send you, after all. I think it’s so mean for parents to send their children away from home. There, don’t kiss me; I’ve just put my hair up.”
After supper, Mr. Travers told me to run out to the barn and see the horses and cows. There were four horses, and two of them were beautiful, only they were all white. Indeed, they were a good deal paler than my dog, so I knew they must be ill. Then there was a large pale cat, that had longer hair than any cat I ever saw, and a short tail. She looked as if she was more ill than the horses. One of the cows kept lowing in a way that made me feel sure that she had a dreadful pain, and I wished that I had some of Mr. Travers’s medicine to give the poor, sick animals.
By-and-by Mr. Travers came out into the back yard with a piece of meat and the paper of medicine, and I 15

said, “ Mr. Travers, won’t you let me give some medicine to the horses and cows ? I’m sure they don’t feel well,” but he looked very angry, and said, “ I’m afraid, my young friend, that you are almost too bright to live very long.” Just then Sue called him, and he had to leave the meat and the medicine on a bench, and go into the house. He had sprinkled a little of the medicine on the meat, and as I noticed the cat smelling the meat, and it seemed to tempt the poor animal’s appetite, I was on the point of giving her a piece of it when I remembered that I had no right to interfere with Mr. Travers’s own animals, so I just walked away, and went to the well to get a drink. When I came back, I found the cat and the dog had eaten the meat between them, and the cat had jumped into the kitchen window to get out of the dog’s way. One of the cows was smelling the rest of the medicine. I drove her away, but not until she had taken a good taste of it, and I wrapped up what was left, and took it to Mr. Travers, whom I met coming out of the house.
He turned quite pale when he saw me, and said, “ You young rascal, you haven’t taken any of that stuff, have you?” and I said, “No, sir; I promised you I wouldn’t, but the dog has been eating the meat.” I was going to tell him about the cat and the cow, but he laughed, and told me to run down to the village and

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe bring him the letters from the post-office. When I got home it was time to go to bed, and I was told that I couldn’t see my dog that night, for he was asleep, and it might injure him to wake him up after taking medicine.
The next morning when we were at breakfast the coachman came in and said, “ If you please, Mr. Travers, the new dog is pizined.” “ What do you mean ?” exclaimed Mr. Travers. “ Is he really hurt ?” “ Yis, sorr,” said the man, “ he’s hurt pretty bad. To tell you truth, sorr, they’re both dead.” “ What on earth are you talking about?” said Mr. Travers, getting up from his seat and looking frightened. “ The dog and the Angora cat, sorr, the pair of them is both very near entirely dead,” replied the coachman, “ and the Alderney cow doesn’t seem to be altogether livin’ this mornin’.” Mr. Travers didn’t wait to hear any more, but seized his hat and started for the barn. The coachman went with him, and as I didn’t want to stay and see Sue cry, I went too. In the back yard, close to the door, I found my dear dog lying dead on the ground, and then I wanted to cry, but of course, not being a girl, I didn’t do it. Between the dog and the barn was the cat, and she was as dead as he was. Then I saw Mr. Travers coming from the barn and looking as if he wanted to kill a few people to keep the animals company. When he came up to me I said: “ Mr.
17

Travers! I know who has poisoned all the animals; it was that young man in the apothecary’s shop.” “ What do you mean by that, Jimmy?” asked Mr. Travers, very savagely. “ I mean, sir,” said I, “ that he must have given you poison instead of medicine, for my dog took it and now he’s dead, and I saw the cat and the Alderney cow taste it, and they’re dead.” I was going to say that the young man ought to be put in jail for making such dreadful mistakes, when Mr. Travers took me by the collar and dragged me up to my room and put me in and locked the door without saying a word.
Now I acknowledge that I did wrong in not letting Mr. Travers know that the cow and the cat had taken the medicine, but that was all I did. It was just forgetfulness and nothing more, and that isn’t always so dreadfully bad. I never had the least idea that the medicine would do any harm, and I should have taken a little myself if Mr. Travers had not made me promise not to. I was awfully sorry that Sue’s cat died, and that Mr. Travers’s cow very nearly died, though the poor thing got well after a while, just as he was probably very sorry that my dog died; but neither of us meant to do any harm, and I do think that he ought to have looked at it just as I did, and blamed nobody but the young man at the apothecary’s shop, who, instead of giving him strych-

nine, must have given him something poisonous. But instead of doing this, Mr. Travers gave me a terrible scolding, such as I never had in my life before, and said I was a young Cain, and that a boy who poisoned animals and tried to kill a man by knocking him out of a carriage on his wedding-day was perfectly certain to be hung. Then he kept me shut up in my room for three days, and gave me nothing but bread and water. This was the beginning of the coolness between us, for I resolved that I would not overlook such conduct, unless he should admit that his conduct had been such and should ask me to forgive him.
But we will say no more of this painful subject, for I don’t like to think of those poor animals cut off in their prime, and without any time for reflection. I suppose the dog is better off now than when he was alive, for he was a sweet, good animal; but I don’t think that cats have a good time after they are gone, for they are cruel and wicked, except when they’re little.
About a week after the mistake about the medicine, Mr. Travers said to me one morning, “ Jimmy, you’ve been idle long enough. If you’re going to stay here you must earn your board, for I can’t afford to keep everybody’s boys for nothing. I want you to weed the garden to-day, and mind you don’t make any mistakes^”

Now I don’t like to weed a garden. Nobody does, for it breaks your back all to pieces, and the sun shines tremendously hot on the back of your head. However, I went to work, and worked hard. It was a big garden, and I weeded the whole of it, only it took me nearly a week, and I was tired to death every night. I made hardly any mistakes. I did pull up all the parsnips, for I thought they were weeds, but parsnips don’t cost very much, and Mr. Travers only scolded me half an hour about it.
I don’t believe in weeding gardens, anyway, and it’s disgraceful that some man hasn’t invented some way of getting rid of weeds without wearing boys’ backs all out; but grown-up folks never seem to think that a boy’s back can ache, and they will actually say, “ Jimmy, I want you to weed the garden for me, for it hurts my back to stoop over.”
The greatest fault that grown-up folks have is a want of thoughtfulness. I don’t believe that as a general thing they are cruel or don’t care how disagreeable they are to boys; but the trouble is, they are heedless and careless, and are so occupied with their own affairs that they never think whether boys like to be punished or made to do unpleasant things. I think it would do them good to distribute tracts to them. When I get time—for I am to 20

go to boarding-school next month, and shall be too busy for anything—I mean to start a society for the improvement of grown-up folks, and have men come and lecture to them with stereopticon views, showing how happy a person can be, and how much ice-cream he can get, and how many circuses he can go to if he treats boys well; and then, how miserable a person is sure to be if he is not good to boys, and persists in his careless, heedless course, which is really almost as bad as deliberate cruelty.

MY next scolding was about the strawberry-bed. There was a beautiful big strawberry-bed, full of ripe strawberries, and one afternoon, when everybody had gone to drive except me, I saw a boy in the strawberrybed stealing berries. So I went and told him to go away immediately^ but he was impudent and said he wouldn’t, and that if I wanted him to get out of that strawberrybed I might try to put him out. So I thought it was my duty to try it, and save Mr. Travers’s strawberries from being stolen. The boy was an Irish boy, and he was full of fight. He waited for me in the middle of the strawberry-bed, and as soon as I began to put him out I found that it was going to be a hard job. But I stuck to it, though most of the time he had me down and we rolled all over the bed. We must have been a half an hour at it, and we were covered just as red as anything with strawberry juice when Mr. Travers came home, and, hearing a noise, came into the garden to see what was the matter. I don’t suppose that by that time there was 22

a strawberry left that wasn’t all mashed up, and most of the plants were trampled to death. Once we fell into the hot-bed that was close to the strawberry-bed and broke eighty-four panes of glass, and ruined most of the plants that were in the bed. The boy was that obstinate that I don’t believe I could ever have put him off that strawberry-bed alone, but I was determined to protect Mr. Travers’s strawberries if I died for it. When Mr. Travers came into the garden and the boy saw him, he threw me about two yards away, and ran so fast that nobody could have caught him. Do you think Mr. Travers thanked me for protecting his strawberries, and said I was a brave, faithful boy, and gave me a new suit of clothes, and some plaster for the places where the glass had cut me, and perhaps fifty cents! Of course you do, but there’s where you are mistaken. What he did do was to call me a little wretch, and to accuse me of spoiling his strawberry - bed and his hot-bed, and of associating with low, fighting, Irish boys. I didn’t want to associate with the boy that day, and wouldn’t have associated with him if I could have helped it. Afterwards I did associate with him, and found that he was a good fellow, and that instead of trying to steal Mr. Travers’s strawberries, he was picking them for the cook, who had hired him to pick them.

I was shut up in my room two more days on bread and water for protecting Mr. Travers’s property, and the coolness between us increased. Sue took his part, and told me that it served me right. “ I’m perfectly disgusted with you bringing Irish boys into our garden to fight, you good-for-nothing little torment.” It was very lonesome in my room, and I was very sorry I had ever come to live with Mr. Travers.
After this little trouble was over, Mr. Travers told me that I was to keep the garden weeded, and help the man take care of the horses, and run all the errands, and that I could have Saturday afternoons to play in if I did nothing wrong all the week and if there was no work to do. I soon found out that there almost always was work to do, so that I hardly ever had a Saturday afternoon for myself.
I am not grumbling because I had to work. There are lots of boys who have to work harder all the year than I did, and if Mr. Travers had been supporting me it would have been only fair I should work for him. But before he was married, when he used to talk about my coming to live with him, he never said a word about work. It was always what fun we’ll have, Jimmy, doing so and so; and then he would tell me about the splendid times we would have going fishing, and swimming, and 24

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe chestnutting, and all sorts of things; and he seemed so fond of me then, and was always giving me ten cents to go down to the post-office when he came to see Sue.
I can’t think what made him change so much after he was married. It couldn’t have been the accident to the cow and the cat, for it began before the accident happened. Besides, he knew it was really and truly an accident. If it wasn’t, why didn’t he put me in jail? Any boy who would poison poor, innocent animals, either for fun or because he was angry with the man they belonged to, ought to be sent to the worst kind of jail and kept there forever. It wasn’t that he made me work that hurt my feelings, but because he never said anything kind to me, and seemed to hate to have me at his house.	'
You can imagine how bad I felt when I made up my mind that I had actually rather go to school than to live all day at Mr. Travers’s house. So I asked him one day when he was going to send me to school. “ Whenever I think proper,” was his answer. And then he added, “ Next winter, perhaps.” When you remember that father was paying my board, and had agreed with Mr. Travers that I was to go to school, you will see that it was hardly fair for him to make me work all summer and never to send me to school at all.

A long while after I had all that trouble in putting the Irish boy off the strawberry-bed, I met him in the street, and told him I had found out that he wasn’t stealing strawberries, and that I was sorry I had hurt him. He looked at me a minute, and then he said, “ You’re a rale jintleman, you are, and whiniver I kin do anything for you just you count on Mike Flanigan, and that’s meself.” Mike and I got to be great friends. He was a first-rate boy. There wasn’t a fellow of his size in town that he couldn’t throw at wrestling, and he could dive and stay under water twice as long as anybody else. Of course he hadn’t been to school much, and he hadn’t any father and mother, and he had red hair, but he was a good, honest chap, and he was the only friend I had in West Thompsonville. We used to go swimming together in the evenings, and sometimes when I had a lot of work to do he would come and help me—taking care that Mr. Travers didn’t see him, or else both of us would have been in a scrape.
We did get into a scrape one day, though. There was a great big cistern in the yard, and Mr. Travers had taken the cover off, for it was pretty well worn out, and a new one was needed. Mike had come to see me in the evening, and we were chasing one another in the yard, and forgot all about the cistem, when Mike ran right 26

into it and disappeared. He came to the top of the water right away, but he couldn’t climb up the sides, and all he could do was to swim and wait for help. There was a ladder standing near the dining-room window, and I ran to get it, but in trying to get it on my shoulder the end swung around and smashed the whole window. Mr. Travers ran out and caught me just as I was putting the ladder into the cistern. He was going to take me into the house at once, but when he heard what was the matter, he waited till I got Mike out, and then spoke to me in his usual way. He wanted to know what I meant by filling up his cistern with Irish boys, and spoiling all the water, besides breaking his windows; and then he said, “ The next time you are guilty of such conduct I shall give you a thrashing that you will remember.”
That hurt my feelings worse than anything else. Father sometimes punished me, but then he had a right to do it, and probably I deserved it. I don’t think Mr. Travers had any right to do anything of the kind, especially when I knew I didn’t deserve it, and I made up my mind that if he really did punish me in that way I would leave the place at once. I said so to Mike the next time I saw him, and he said that he would go with me anywhere I might go. “ We can go and be pirates or

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
fight the Injuns or any other blatherin’ thing you may be after doing. It’s meself that’s tired of this place, anyway, and we can’t well do worse wheriver we go.”
Mike had no home, for his father and mother had died a great while ago, and he had lived with his grandmother till she died; and now he was living with an Irishman who had a wife and nine children, and no money and very little work, so he invited Mike to come and stay with him, and treated him pretty well.
There was no reason in the world why Mike shouldn’t run away if he wanted to, especially as he might meet his uncle Patrick somewheres, and then he would be a rich boy. Mike’s uncle was a most remarkable and excellent man—that is, according to what Mike said about him, for I never saw him. Mike said his uncle had made lots of money when he was a pirate. He must have been a good many things besides a pirate, for Mike told me at different times of about twenty different businesses that his uncle had been in. But whatever business his uncle was in, he was always meeting with lovely and terrifying adventures, and he must have been one of the bravest and strongest men that ever lived.
It happened one Saturday afternoon that I got through with my work about two o’clock. Everybody had gone out to spend the day, and Mike and I were sitting at the 28

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
back of the bam in the shade, and I was poking the ground with a sharp stick, when I had the wonderful luck to discover a nail-mine. First I found one nail, and then as I stirred the ground up with the stick I found thirteen more. There couldn’t be the least doubt that there was a nail-mine in that very place, and Mike agreed with me that if we could work the mine ourselves and sell all the nails we would be rich in a very little while.
I had read a good deal about mines, and knew just how to go to work. You can never get much out of a mine by just scratching up the top of the ground. You must find in what direction the vein runs under the ground and then follow it. The best way to do this is to dig a big hole like a well in the place where you know there is a mine, and then dig galleries or long tunnels in every direction from the bottom of the hole until you strike the vein. When you strike the vein there is nothing more to be done, except to follow the vein and get out all the gold or silver or nails or whatever it is that there is in the mine. In some mines this big hole, or shaft, as we miners call it, is mornamile deep, and the galleries are so long that you can never get to the end of them without horses or railroads.
Mike, after I had explained everything to him, wanted to dig a shaft just where we were sitting, but I told him 29
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe that this wouldn’t do, for Mr. Travers would be sure to see it, and then he would take the mine away from us. Of course he would have no right to do this if we should write on a board, a This mine is mine and Mike Flanigan’s,” and put it up by the side of the shaft, but he would do it all the same, and we couldn’t help ourselves.
Luckily there was a way by which we could work the mine without letting anybody know anything about it. The floor of the barn was made of loose boards, and was raised about two feet from the ground. All we had to do was to take up three or four boards, dig a shaft inside the barn and close to the place where we found the nails. We could dig at night and put the boards back again before morning, and then we could put all the earth that we dug out of the shaft out of sight under the barn floor.
As the coachman was away we determined to begin the shaft that afternoon, so I went into the house and hunted up two fire-shovels, and a poker to use for a crowbar, and we took up four planks of the barn floor and went to work. We made the shaft four feet wide, and marked it out on the ground with a piece of chalk. The ground was dry and soft, and we dug down three feet before it was time to quit work and cover the shaft up.
30

We left the tools in the shaft, and I wrote a notice on the under side of the floor, so that in case any honest miner should happen to find it he would know the mine was ours.
I couldn’t find a lantern to work with by night, but Mike managed to get one, and he used to come regularly under my window at eleven o’clock every night and call me. Then we would dig for four hours, and afterwards sleep on the hay until morning. Nobody at our house ever got up in the morning until eight o’clock, except the cook, and so nobody noticed anything strange about my being up and in the garden at seven.
One thing that troubled me a good deal was clothes. A miner ought to wear big boots, a red flannel shirt, and - a broad-brimmed hat, and he always carries a revolver. I knew this because I had seen lots of pictures of miners. Now Mike had a red flannel shirt, but he had neither boots, revolver, nor broad-brimmed hat; and I had nothing that was fit for a miner, and every time we went to dig with white shirts and shoes, and no revolvers, I knew we were doing wrong. But Mike happened to remember, after we had been digging about a week, that his uncle had worked for a great many years in the deepest coalmine in the world, and had told him that it was so hot down in the mine that he and the other miners wore no clothes at all except an old pair of trousers. After that
31

we used to take off all our clothes except our trousers, and though it was awfully cold in the middle of the night, I felt that we were not disgracing ourselves by wearing the wrong kind of clothes.

THERE was another thing that worried me while we were miners. According to some lovely stories that I once read about some gold-miners in California who let a nice man named Mr. Harte into all their private affairs, and never found any fault with him when he printed all they told him in the newspaper, all miners in California chew tobacco. I thought it all over. I hated the idea of chewing tobacco; but then if we were miners I thought we ought to do what other miners did. So I told Mike that I was very sorry, but it would really be necessary for him to get some tobacco and to help me chew it while we were at work.
“ All right,” said Mike, “ I’ll chew anything you say; but there’s another thing you’re after forgittin’. Accordin’ to Uncle Pathrick ivery miner swears a blue streak pretty much all the time; so you see if we’re goin’ to do things in rale rigular style we’ve got to swear.” That was something I wouldn’t do for anybody; so I thought that as long as we were going to work without 33
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe swearing it wouldn’t do any particular harm to work without chewing tobacco. It may be that only goldminers and coal-miners chew and swear, and that it isn’t necessary for nail-miners to do anything of the kind. At any rate, we didn’t do it, and I afterwards made up my mind that I wouldn’t do it for all the nail-mines in the world.
About the first of July, after working three weeks, we had dug a shaft ten feet deep, and we began to dig a gallery in the direction of the place where we had found what miners call “ a surface show of nails.” We made the roof of the gallery as high as we could reach with our tools, for we thought it very likely that we might miss the vein by digging too deep. We made a little ladder to help us get down to the bottom of the shaft, and when we quit work we always took out the ladder and hid it under the barn floor.
The first day while we were working in the gallery we found two nails, which encouraged us very much; but after that we did not find a single one. We made the gallery six feet long, and then decided that we had missed the vein. Sometimes miners will dig for miles right along by the side of a vein and never dream that it is there, while all the time it is only three or four inches from them. It was such hard work digging that we
34

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe didn’t want to begin another gallery unless it should be absolutely necessary; so I told Mike we would try making the gallery wider, and perhaps we would hit the vein on one side or the other. We made it a good deal wider, but could not find the vein, and had decided to make another gallery, when an accident happened.
Sue used to walk out to the barn every once in a while to see the horses. One day she was missing when dinner was ready, and nobody knew where she was. Mr. Travers looked all over the house and the garden, but could not find her, and at last he went to the barn to see if she was there.
Well, Mr. Travers didn’t come back, and about suppertime I went out to the barn to see what in the world had become of him and Sue. I didn’t see them at first, but I heard them calling, “ Help, murder, fire,” and all sorts of things every little while. The sound seemed to come from a cellar, and I couldn’t imagine where they were until I went around behind the barn. There I was astonished to find a great big hole with Sue and Mr. Travers at the bottom of it.
' What had happened was this: Sue was walking behind the barn, when the gallery of the nail-mine caved in and she went clear to the bottom. She wasn’t hurt, but of course she was dreadfully frightened, and she
35
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
couldn’t get out. She had been in the mine about three hours when Mr. Travers came to look for her, and as he was standing on the edge of the hole and asking for goodness’ sake what she was doing down there, the mine caved in a little more and he joined her. He wasn’t hurt, but he couldn’t get out any more than Sue could. I suppose it was a little tedious for him to stay in the mine four hours, for he had no work to do and nothing to amuse him. Anyway, he was awfully cross when I found him. I brought the big ladder—the same that I got Mike out of the well with—and though it was tremendously heavy, I managed to put one end of it into the mine, though it accidentally hit Mr. Travers on the nose and made it bleed, and as he was already covered with dirt he didn’t look a bit nice when he came up out of the mine.
Of course this increased the coolness between Mr. Travers and me, and Sue joined in and said, “ Why don’t you give that boy what he needs—a good whipping is what he wants,” which wasn’t true, for I didn’t want anything of the kind; and it is not right for people to tell what isn’t true, even if they have accidentally gone down a mine. I was very much surprised that Mr. Travers did not lock me up, but he only said some cross things to me and told me I had better take care. I suppose he was so 36
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe glad to have a nail-mine in his yard that he was willing to forget how he came to discover it.
Mike and I expected that Mr. Travers would work the nail-mine and make lots of money out of it, but he just had the mine all filled up again. He didn’t even put up a notice that the mine was his. The truth is he was ashamed to take it away from Mike and me, and so he determined to do nothing with it until we should grow up and go away, and then he intended to make believe that he had just discovered it. At least that’s what I think, for of course he didn’t tell his plans to anybody.
For some time after this everything went on as usual, and nobody gave me any extra scolding—only the regular daily allowance; but this could not last, as anybody who knows what some grown-up folks are might have known.
I had been at Mr. Travers’s house for nearly two months before I tried to climb for the crow’s nest in the elm-tree. This was a tremendous big tree, and it stood quite near to the barn, but for a long time I felt so disappointed that I didn’t have the heart to climb it. Mike and I tried it at last, and we had a hard time getting up the trunk. It was so big that we couldn’t clasp it, and so smooth that we couldn’t stick to it. We tried the plan that some heathens try, though I forget where they live. They take a rope and tie one end to their waist, and pass 37
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
the other end around a tree, and tie it to their waist again. Then they start to climb, and every time they lean back the rope holds them, so that they can rest as long as they want to, and then climb some more. But we found that this wouldn’t work. The rope would sometimes hold us a little while, and give us a chance to rest, but it couldn’t help us up a tree where there was nothing to catch hold of. For my part, I don’t believe in those heathen inventions. Look at the boomerang which everybody says an Australian heathen can throw so that it will go clear round a house and come back and hit a heathen standing half a mile behind the one who threw it. This isn’t true, because I once tried it, and the boomerang acted just exactly like any other stick. Besides, if the heathen can do such wonderful things, they might get along without missionaries, which would save a great deal of money. Of course, they would need good books, and Sunday-school libraries, and all that, but they wouldn’t need missionaries to set up schools for them.
We got up the tree at last by cutting notches in the sides with a hatchet to put our feet in. This was my invention, though I afterwards heard that some heathens somewhere claim to have invented it. But nobody, I suppose, will take a heathen’s word against mine. I invented the plan of cutting notches in the tree entirely
38

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
by myself, and if any heathen has read about it in the paper, and then gone and pretended to invent it himself, he has done a pretty mean thing.
It took us all Saturday afternoon to cut notches enough in the tree to get up to where the branches began, but we got there at last, and then it was easy climbing till we got within about twenty feet of the crow’s nest. The limb that the nest was on was partly dead, and it was too dangerous to think of climbing it. Mike wanted to cut the limb off, but I knew Mr. Travers wouldn’t like that, so I wouldn’t let him do it. “ I’ll tell you what we’ll do, Mike,” said I. “ We’ll strike the nest with lightning. That ’ll be just as good as cutting off the limb, and it won’t get us into a scrape.”
“And is it bossin’ the lightnin’ ye are?” said Mike. “ What’s the good of talkin’ that fashion ? If you mane shootin’, say so, but don’t be after callin’ a gun lightnin’.”
But when I explained what I meant to do, Mike stopped making fun of me, and said it was the most elegant plan he had ever heard of.
There was a lightning-rod on the barn, on the side next the tree. It wasn’t a thick piece of iron like the one on our barn at home, but it was a sort of twisted wire, about as light as rope. I told Mike we would dig up the
4 39
Digitized by Google
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe end of the rod where it went into the ground, and take it up the tree and push the end up as near to the nest as we could, and then leave it there. The first time a thunder-storm would come along, the lightning would start to run down the rod into the ground as usual, but of course it would follow the rod up into the tree, and hit the nest, and knock the crows mornamile high.
Mike remembered, after I told him what I meant to do, that he had heard his uncle tell how, when he was a pirate, he had sunk a ship with lightning, though it was by accident. He had captured a Spanish galleon, which is a big ship, loaded with barrels full of gold and silver, and he had knocked in the heads of the barrels, and taken all the gold and silver out, and put it on his own ship. Then he made all the Spaniards walk the plank. But while Mike’s uncle and all his men were busy taking the gold and silver from one ship to the other, the Spaniards took the lightning-rod that ran from the top of the mast and put the end of it into one of the empty barrels down in the cellar of the ship.
After all the Spaniards were drowned, Mike’s uncle put a prize crew of seven hundred men on the galleon, and told them to keep her Nor-nor-west and follow close after the pirate ship. In the middle of the night there was an awful thunder-storm, and the lightning ran into 40

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
the barrel till it was as full as it could hold. The next morning, one of the men took a lamp and went down cellar to get some milk for breakfast, and happened to bring the candle close to the open barrel of lightning. Of course, the lightning caught fire, and the galleon blew up with a bang that made all the pirates deaf for a month. Not the least bit of the galleon was ever seen again, and all that was ever found of the seven hundred men of the prize crew was one ear that fell on the deck of the pirate ship, and was found to be the ear of the chief officer, because it had a beautiful diamond ear-ring in it that Mike’s uncle had given him for saving his life in a great battle on the Chinese Sea.
We had hard work to dig up the end of the rod, for it had grown about twenty feet into the ground. Then we had trouble besides in getting the rod loose from the side of the barn, for it was fastened in three places. However, the ladder was long enough to reach the highest of these, and we wrenched the rod loose with a hammer. Then we carried it up the tree, and you wouldn’t believe how much it weighed by the time we got it up there; which shows that things weigh more high up than they do on the ground, though none of the men who come around in the winter and lecture and you have to go and listen to them and improve your mind ever found it out.

We got the end of the rod up to within two feet of the bottom of the nest, and you should have seen how disgusted the crows were when they came back to the nest at night and saw that something was wrong. They didn’t understand it, however, and made up their minds to stay and risk the consequences.
After it was all done, I began to be a little worried, for fear Mr. Travers might notice the rod and the notches in the tree, and, instead of waiting to hear me explain, might be unreasonable, and find fault with me. But I didn’t have to wait long for a thunder-storm.
That night I was waked up about two o’clock by an awful thunder-storm, and before I could get asleep again I was waked up some more by a bright light shining into my window, and by hfearing people running and shouting in the yard. I got up, and as soon as I looked out of the window I saw what was the matter. The lightning had worked beautifully, and not only knocked the crow’s nest to pieces, but had set the whole tree on fire. Mr. Travers and a lot of men were putting wet blankets on the roof of the barn to prevent it from taking fire, and some other men were cutting the tree down. They got it cut down in time to save the barn, and when I had run and shouted fire, and done everything I could to help, I went to bed, wondering what Mr. Travers would say in the morning.

THE next morning at breakfast Mr. Travers told Sue what a wonderful thing had happened. He said that he meant to write to the newspapers about the remarkable freak of lightning at the house of our well-known fellowcitizen, Henry D. Travers, Esq., and to say that the lightning had taken a lightning-rod off from the barn, and twisted it all up in the tree, and had made regular notches in the trunk of the tree that looked almost exactly as if they had been made with a hatchet. He said that he hated to lose a valuable tree, and that he had come very near losing the barn too, but that he was almost reconciled to it on account of the wonderful way the lightning had acted. Then he told a whole lot of stories about wonderful performances of lightning, and how a girl who wore a beautiful pair of gold bracelets with diamonds in them was once sitting at the parlor window in a thunder-storm, and the lightning struck the bracelets, and cut both her hands off as neatly as if it had been done with a razor; and the doctors all said it was on 43

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
account of the diamonds in the bracelets, which attracted the lightning. Sue believed it, because girls don’t know anything about lightning, but I didn’t believe a word of it, because I remembered that Sue had been teasing Mr. Travers to get her a pair of bracelets with diamonds in them, and he merely wanted to frighten her, which I think was real mean.
I thought it wasn’t fair to let Mr. Travers believe that the tree was struck by lightning all by accident, when it really happened because Mike and I had meddled a little with the lightning-rod; sb after breakfast I told him just how it had happened. I never saw him so angry before, and he couldn’t have spoken more impolitely to me if I had set the tree on fire on purpose. He would have locked me up, only there was a lot of work he wanted me to do, and he didn’t want to punish me any other way, because he was expecting a visit that day from a lady who knew father, and who might not like if she happened to hear about it. So he scolded me awhile, and ended up by saying, a Remember I warned you last time what you had to expect, and you can depend on it that the next thing you do you’ll catch it.”
He told the truth that time, and I did catch it, as you will see.
There was a spring about a mile from the house in 44
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
Mr. Wilson’s pasture, and one day Mr. Travers said, “ Jimmy, take a tin pail and go down to the spring and bring me some water.”
It’s a curious thing that grown-up people are never content with their own well-water, but must always be wanting water from a spring that is a long way off, and of course a boy must go and get it. Why don’t they have their springs close to their houses, or else, if they must have spring-water, why don’t they get a cart and bring a hogshead full of spring-water up to the house and keep it there ? But no, a boy must always go for it with a big tin pail, which is awfully heavy when it is full. Then when you get the pail of water up to the house, and it has slopped all over into your shoes, and wet the rest of your clothes, the grown-up folks always say, “ You careless boy, you’ve spilt half the water, and I’ve a great mind to send you back for some more.” Besides, it’s all nonsense about one kind of water being better than another, unless it’s soda-water with vanilla and cream. I wouldn’t mind going to a soda-water spring, but nobody ever sends you there. .
As I started out with the pail the cook said to me, “Look out for the ram, Master Jimmy.” Mr. Travers heard her and said, “ Never you mind the ram, Jimmy; he never hurts boys.” I wasn’t a bit afraid, and I
45
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe said so, but then I never had any quarrel with a ram before.
There was a flock of sheep in the pasture, but I didn’t notice any ram until I had filled the pail and started for home. All at once something hit me an awful blow, and knocked me over the pail and spilt all the water. I looked around, and there was the ram waiting for me to get up. Well, I got up, and was going back to fill the pail when the ram came at me again. There was no dodging him, he came so fast, and down I went the second time. After that I dropped the pail and started for the fence, but it was a long way off, and the ram kept knocking me down all the way. I was so lame when I got over the fence that I could hardly walk home, and if I had been a girl I’d have cried so you could have heard me a mile.
When I told Mr. Travers what had happened he said I was a coward, and that if I didn’t go back and get that pail and bring it home full of water, something a good deal worse than a ram would hit me. Now I didn’t like being knocked down, and I invented a plan for getting even with that ram and persuading him to let me alone.
Mr. Travers had a pretty big looking-glass in his room, and I slipped up-stairs, put it on my head, and started for 40

the spring. If there is anything a ram loves it is to butt another ram, and it stands to reason that if a ram sees himself in a looking-glass he’ll think it is another extraugly ram, and will run at it.
There was a big rock in the pasture near the fence, and I stood the looking-glass up against it, and stood in front of it and waited for the ram. As soon as he saw me he put his head down and came for me, but when he was about two rods off I jumped behind the rock, and he saw himself in the glass. He thought it was the worst-looking ram he had ever seen, and he lowered his head a little more and put on a little extra speed and hit that ram an awful blow straight on the head. At least that’s what he thought he did, and you never saw anybody so astonished as he was when he found that the other ram had disappeared, and that he had nearly knocked his own brains out against a rock, and that a bigdooking-glass frame was hanging around his neck like a collar. He couldn’t make it out, and every time he tried to run, the frame would trip him up and down he would come. I didn’t wait to explain things to him, but filled the pail and carried it home without any accident.
Mr. Travers said, “ There! I knew you could do it if you wanted to,” and he was quite pleasant for the rest of the day; but about sunset Mr. Wilson came over, carry-
47
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe ing the looking-glass frame, just as Mr. Travers had noticed that his looking-glass had gone, and was calling out, “ Sue, what on earth have you women been doing in my room?” Mr. Wilson looked very solemn, and said: “ Mr. Travers, I found my valuable ram dead in the pastur this afternon with thishyer round his neck. He bled to death on account of broken glass, and he was worth fifty dollars if he was worth a cent. As your card is tacked on to thishyer frame, p’r’aps you’ll explain what it means, and then pay my bill.”
You may not believe it, but Mr. Travers at once suspected me—he was the most suspicious man I ever knew —and said, “Jimmy! tell me instantly what you’ve been doing.” Of course I told him, and I supposed he would say I had done quite right to protect myself from a bloodthirsty, awful ram, so that I could bring home some delicious spring-water—as Mr. Travers called it. But as usual he was unreasonable, and told me to go immediately to my room. I could hear him out of the window arguing with Mr. Wilson about his bill, but Mr. Wilson stuck to it that Mr. Travers owed him thirty dollars, that he would never take a cent less, and that if Mr. Travers didn’t pay he would sue him; and finally I saw Mr. Travers pay him twenty-five dollars to settle it. About

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe ten minutes later Mr. Travers came into my room with a switch in his hand, without giving me the least warning so that I could have had time to get a few shingles or an atlas, and I don’t call that fair, no matter who says it is.
I ask permission to draw a vale of tears over what followed. I heard our minister often and often say that this world is all a vale of tears, but I never really understood it until that afternoon. I didn’t mind much when I used to go up-stairs with father, except once when he had a new cane that was full of knobs, but I felt ashamed of Mr. Travers’s conduct—that was why I felt so bad.
I knew now that it was all over between us, and that I should run away and go to father. I knew where father was, for in his last letter he said he was staying at the Grand Hotel, and expected to stay there two months longer. If I could only get to Europe and ask somebody to direct me to the Grand Hotel, I could walk right in and say to father, “ Dear father! there is a coolness between me and Mr. Travers, so I have come to stay with you.” And he would say: “ My dear boy, how glad I am to see you! We’ll go and have some ice-cream, and then you shall go to the circus.”
After everybody was in bed I got out of the window 49
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
and went down to Mike’s. He hadn’t gone to bed yet, and we went out into the woodshed and I told him what had happened, and that I was going to Europe, only I wanted him to go too. He said he’d be ready in five minutes, but I explained to him that Europe was a long way off, and that before we started we must lay plans, and collect provisions and money and things, and that he must come up to the house the next night, and we’d talk it all over and get everything arranged.
I knew how to go to Europe; that is, I knew how father went. You go first to New York, and there you go on a steamboat, and the steamboat takes you straight to Europe. Father went on the railroad to New York, but that costs a good deal of money; and then you have to pay a great deal—as much as three or four dollars, I suppose—to the steamboat man to take you to Europe. Then you’ve got to take your lunch with you, or else buy things to eat, and that costs more. I calculated that it must have cost father every bit of ten dollars to get from our house to Europe, and Mike thought so too, after I had explained it all to him.
Now I had a dollar and eighteen cents, and Mike had five cents, so it was very certain that we could not afford to take the railroad or to pay the steamboat man anything, for we should need all our money to buy lunch 50

So you see we had to be very careful to talk the thing over and to make proper preparations, so that we should not find ourselves half-way to Europe without being able to get there or to come back.
I know that a boy ought never to run away from home, but there is no law against his running away from Mr. Travers’s when there is a coolness between them and it isn’t the boy’s fault. Of course I made some mistakes while I lived with Mr. Travers, for we all make mistakes. But I meant to do all right, and Mr. Travers had no right to treat me the way he did. Besides, I made up my mind that if father said I had done wrong, and wanted me to go back to Mr. Travers, I would obey him. I did not mind having to work, but I am sure father never would have sent me to stay with Mr. Travers if he had known how Mr. Travers would treat me.
Mike came the next night, but I was sound asleep, and he had to get the ladder and climb up to my room and wake me; and I thought first he was a robber and was going to call for help, when he caught me from behind and jammed a pillow against my mouth and threw me down on the floor and sat on me. After I was quiet, 51

If it hadn’t been for Mike’s presence of mind there would have been a dreadful scene, for Mr. Travers would have come and caught us, and would most likely have shot Mike before asking him to explain.
Presence of mind is a great thing. There was once a man who was walking along the road and he saw a horse and carriage come tearing along, for the horse was running away, and there were people in the carriage who were sure to be killed unless the horse could be stopped before he ran into something. There was a deep river by the side of the road, and the man rushed out in front of the horse and yelled and danced and waved a newspaper and frightened the horse, so that he dragged the carriage off the side of the road into the river and was drowned, and all the people in the carriage were drowned too. If it hadn’t been for this man’s presence of mind the horse would have been sure to run into something, and the people would have had all their legs broke or their brains knocked out. This shows us what a valuable thing presence of mind is.
After I had got my breath again we climbed down the ladder and went round behind the barn where we found the nail-mine, and there we sat down and made our plans.

It was a bright moonlight night, but it was pretty cold, though it was the middle of July; and it is lucky that it was so cold, for that made me remember that we must take some kind of a blanket with us to cover over us on the way to Europe.

MIKE didn’t altogether want to go to Europe. He said he thought it would be a great deal better for us to go to the plains and fight the Indians and kill buffaloes and wild turkeys, and then get a place in a circus and call ourselves “ Wild Jim ” and a Mike the Holy Terror,” and make no end of money. He said lots of fellows did it, for he had read three or four books about them, and what other fellows did we could do. If I didn’t care to fight Indians, then he thought we had better stay close by West Thompsonville in a cave and be a gang of highwaymen.
I must say that I should have liked nothing better than to be Wild Jim, or the Howling Horror of the Great West, but I told Mike that we were not going away to amuse ourselves, but to find father. “ And it’s mighty fine amusement the old jintleman will be after givin’ us whin we do find him, I’m thinkin’,” interrupted Mike. As for being a highwayman and living in a cave, of course it’s nonsense to say that it wouldn’t be perfectly splendid if 54

it was only right to rob people, but it isn’t. Little boys never think so far as this, for I remember that once, when I was little, Tom M’Ginnis and I started to run away and be pirates, and never thought that it is against the law to be pirates, and that nowadays very few good honest people are in the business. However, Mike said that though he wasn’t very anxious to go to Europe, he’d go as long as I wanted him to, and that perhaps he could fight Indians there.
As we would have to walk to New York, I said that the way for us to do would be to find out on the map the exact direction of New York, and then to take my compass with me and walk in a perfectly straight line till we should come to New York. My compass was made a present to me a great many years ago, and wasn’t I glad that I had kept it. This shows how useful it is always to keep things, for some day you will want them. There was once a man who had a watch that wouldn’t go, because all the works were lost out of it, and he was going to throw it away, because it was only made of nickel, and his wife said, “ No, John, keep it; you don’t know when it may be very handy.” So he kept it hung up in his room, and the hands always pointed to three o’clock. And one day there came a man who wanted the man to subscribe for some dreadful book that he didn’t want to

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe read and nobody ever could read, and the man talked for an hour, and would have kept on talking all day, only he happened to look at the watch, and jumped up and said: “My goodness! it’s three o’clock, and I promised to meet the Reverend Mr. Baxter at a quarter to three! Good-by; I must go!” and away he went, and never knew that the real time was only one o’clock, and that he might have talked an hour and a half more. So the watch proved to be useful at last, and the man was ever so glad that he had kept it.
Mike said he owned a blanket and a coffee-pot which had belonged to his grandmother who was dead, and he would carry these with us. He said, too, that he knew where he could borrow a hatchet for just as long as he wanted it, and that he would sharpen it on the grindstone. I had very little to take with me except the compass and an extra suit of clothes, an extra pair of shoes, and my jack-knife; but I did have a piece of india-rubber cloth that used to be our piano-cover and that mother gave me to play tent with. I had a lot of kite string and a silver spoon, but this was about all.
Mike and I both agreed that we ought to have guns and pistols, but of course we couldn’t get them; but Mike knew how to make elegant cross-bows that would shoot like anything, and he said he would make two, and we
66

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe could use them to defend ourselves and to kill game with. I agreed to save up my supper and breakfast for three or four days, so that we would have plenty of provisions. Mike promised to have the cross-bows done in a week, and we agreed to start the first night after they were ready.
The next day I began to save provisions. It was easy enough to save bread at breakfast, for Sue never came to breakfast, and Mr. Travers always read the newspaper and paid no attention to me. It was different at supper, however, and though I tried to drop pieces of ham in my lap somebody was almost sure to catch me at it and say: M Jimmy, you’re dropping your food again. If you can’t learn to eat decently you will have to take your meals in the kitchen.” This would have suited me very well, but they only said it to scold me, and didn’t mean to send me into the kitchen, where they knew the cook would give me preserves and . all the best things.
I tried to save some lovely pudding at dinner one day, but I only got into trouble. I watched my chance and dropped a whole lot on my handkerchief, which I had in my lap? and then wrapped it up and slid it into my pocket. But the pudding was awfully hot, and before long it began to burn so that I could not stand it, and I got up to run to my room; but Mr. Travers called me back, and said, ^You’ve dropped something on your
57
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe clothes again; take your handkerchief and wipe it off this minute.” There was no help for it, and I pulled the handkerchief out as carefully as I could, but it came open and all the pudding went on the floor. A good deal was said about it which was not at all pleasant, and I was told that I was a greedy pig, and should not have any more pudding for a week.
All I was able to save was about enough ham for one lunch for Mike and me, four lumps of sugar, a sardine which greased my clothes dreadfully, a small piece of cheese, two pieces of cake, a little peach, sweetmeats which ran out of my handkerchief into my pocket and stuck it together so tight that it was a long time before I could use it, and a lot of bread. Altogether it was enough to feed Mike and me for three days, provided we didn’t eat but half rations. Shipwrecked sailors live on half rations for weeks, sometimes, and half rations is a teaspoonful of food and half a thimbleful of water.
It took Mike ten days instead of a week to make the two cross-bows. They were just elegant. The bows were only about a foot and a half long, but they were made out of an old steel scythe that Mike found, and that the blacksmith let him work into bows in his shop. Mike had made twelve short arrows with sharp nails in the end, and they would hit anything almost as hard as a 58

bullet would. We went out and tried them by shooting at a mark and found they would shoot beautifully straight, for we could hit a barrel two rods off at least once in every five times. We came very near having a bad accident, for when I was aiming at the barrel the first time Mike came in front of my cross-bows to look along the barrel of it and see if I was holding it straight, when it suddenly went off and the arrow hit him on the nose and stayed there until he pulled it out. It was very lucky that it did not hit him in the eye, for the nail was a little rusty, and that made his nose swell up terribly. Mike wanted to try the cross-bows on Mr. Travers’s chickens, but I wouldn’t let him, for I couldn’t afford to pay for a chicken in case we killed one.
We were now all ready, and on Monday night I packed up and waited for Mike. I put the provisions in a handkerchief and wrapped my spare clothes round them, and rolled the india-rubber cloth around the whole. Then I tied strings round the bundle, so that I could sling it on my shoulders like a knapsack. I made a belt out of my trunk strap, which I put round my waist to hold the arrows, and I put the compass in my pocket.
The last thing I did after packing was to write a letter to father. I didn’t write to Mr. Travers, for I didn’t want to tell him where I was going; but I thought it
59
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe wouldn’t be right to surprise father by walking into the Grand Hotel without letting him know I was coming. This is what I wrote:
“Mb. Tbavebs’s, West Thompsonville, "July 30th.
“Diab Fatheb,—There is such a coolness between Mr. Travers and me that I can’t stay here any longer, and I am going to Europe to meet you. I will come to the Grand Hotel and ask for you. Mike Flanigan is going with me, and I’m sure you’ll be glad to know him. He makes elegant cross-bows. Good-by, dear father, and give my love to all. As it is getting late I must close.
“ Your affectionate son,
“James Bbown.”
I didn’t have any postage-stamps, so I directed the letter to father at the “ Grand Hotel, Europe,” and left it on the table in my room for Mr. Travers to send. I knew he could afford to pay the postage and that he would have to write to father, anyhow, and tell him I had left West Thompsonville, so it wouldn’t cost him any more to add a postscript to my letter and send that than it would to write a whole new one. Of course I knew that when Mr. Travers read my letter to father, as he was sure to do, he would know that I had gone to New 60

York, for you’ve got to go to New York to find the steamboat if you’re going to Europe; but I wasn’t a bit afraid that he could catch me, for, as I have said, I meant to go in a straight line instead of going along the regular road.
Mike was to come for me at two o’clock, for we wanted to get clear of the house in the dark, and then wait for daylight so that we could see the compass. According to the map New York was just one hundred miles southeast of West Thompsonville; though I afterwards found that this was a mistake, and that it was about two hundred miles instead of one.
I didn’t dare to go to sleep, for fear I would not wake up at two o’clock, and I never knew anything so long as that night was from the time I went to bed till the clock struck two. It did strike at last, however, and I got out of the window and pet Mike at the gate. Somebody had left the wheelbarrow in the middle of the front yard, and I fell over it with an awful crash and made sure that Mr. Travers would wake up and come out with a gun, but he didn’t. Mike and I ran about half a mile down the road and then went into a grove and lay down to rest and wait for daylight. We talked awhile, and then we were both so sleepy that we went to sleep, and didn’t wake up until it was broad daylight

We each had about a square inch of ham and a piece of bread for breakfast, and then we looked at the compass and started southeast for New York. After we got through the grove we came to a big field, and when we got through this we found a house directly ahead.
We didn’t dare to go near the house, and so we had to turn out for it. However, I remembered a big tree that was in a straight line towards New York, on the other side of the house, and we made a big circle round the house till we came to that tree, so that we need not lose our path. I didn’t want to turn out for anything, but we couldn’t have gone straight over a house even if we had wanted to.
We marched straight on till nearly noon, when the sun was so hot and we were so tired that we had to stop. Besides, we had come to a stream that was too wide to jump over and too deep to wade, and we wanted to make preparations to cross it.
We had some more half rations, besides a bite of cheese for lunch, and then we took another sleep. When we woke up there was a big bull on the other side of the stream waiting for us. You should have heard the bellow he gave when he saw we were awake, and he supposed we were all ready to cross over and let him toss us. We thought that he couldn’t get at us where we were, so we

just sat and laughed at him,'and said: “ Oh yes, you’re a nice bull, you are. Why don’t you come across and toss us? You’re afraid, you know”—and other things that made him so raging that he tore up the earth and lashed around with his tail as if he had been talking politics at the tavern.
It is never safe to say unpleasant things to a bull, and if there is one thing a bull hates more than another, it is to be told that he is afraid. There was once a bull that everybody was afraid of, though he had never hurt anybody, and one day a man came around who was distributing tracts, and he had a young lady with him to help to distribute, in case they should meet somebody who didn’t want tracts, and who was so strong that nobody could distribute them to him without help. This man insisted on crossing the pasture where the bull was, and when he was near enough for the bull to hear him, he said: “ Pshaw! don’t be ridiculous. That bull’s afraid to touch anybody, and he knows it.” In about one minute the man found himself sailing up mornahundred feet into the air, and he would have been seriously killed when he came down if he hadn’t fallen on the young woman’s head, and her hair was so thick on the top of her head that he was only a little bruised. The bull was satisfied with what he had done, and he began to amuse himself

with tracts, and distributed them all over the field, instead of distributing the man any more. So the man and the young lady escaped, and it was an awful warning to him never to say insulting things about a bull again.

AFTER a while the bull suddenly trotted up the stream, and we thought we had seen the last of him; so we undressed, and were just going to swim across, when the bull appeared on our side of the brook close by, and coming straight at us. I jumped for a tree, and climbed out of reach in a minute, but Mike stopped to pick up his cross-bow, and the bull nearly caught him. He had to dodge behind a tree, but couldn’t find time to climb it, for the bull kept chasing him in a circle around the tree for the next ten minutes. Then the bull happened to see Mike’s red shirt on the grass, and he went for that, and while he was worrying it Mike had a chance to climb up by me.
We were both safe enough, but it wasn’t a bit comfortable in the tree. There were mornamillion mosquitoes there, besides two horse-flies, and a full set of ants. There was a caterpillar’s nest too, but that we didn’t mind, for it’s only girls that are afraid of caterpillars, but the other insects made it very lively for us. The 65

bull, after he had finished with Mike’s shirt, made up his mind to wait for us until we got ready to come down, and as he had plenty of time on his hands, he was very well contented to crop grass, and bellow whenever we moved and he thought he were getting ready to be tossed.
We had to stay in that tree from about two o’clock till sunset, when the bull gave it up and went home. There wasn’t an inch on us anywhere that something hadn’t bitten, and Mike’s nose was swelled up worse than ever. We came down, took a swim, and then started across the field where we first saw the bull, and camped out for the night in another grove, where we were sure he couldn’t find us. That night we didn’t have any supper, for the bundle of provisions had been stamped on two or three times by the bull, and it had been in the sun all the afternoon, and it had got wet when we swam across the stream, and when we looked at it we didn’t feel hungry enough to eat it, so we threw it away.
We were pretty cold that night, for almost all our clothes were a little wet. Mike had nothing to put on in the place of his red shirt that the bull had torn to pieces, so I gave him my spare coat; but it was so small that he could not button it in front, and he had to rip the sleeves open at the shoulders so that he could get it on.
We had forgotten to bring any matches, only two W

that Mike found in his pocket, and We didn’t find those till the next morning, so that we couldn’t build any fire. I couldn’t get asleep for a good while because I was pretty sure I heard bears near by, and because it was so cold; but after a while we went to sleep and woke up in the morning feeling awfully stiff.
Mike said he would take his cross-bow and go and kill a bird, and it was while we were talking about cooking the bird that we thought of matches and he found two in his pocket. We built a fire and got warm, and then Mike went off for birds while I lay down again near the fire.
Presently a big crow came into a tree close by, and I shot him with my cross-bow the very first try. He wasn’t killed, but he fluttered around on the ground till I caught him and wrung his neck. I couldn’t pick the feathers off, but after a while I thought of skinning him, which I found a very easy job. Then I ran a sharp stick through him, and held him on the fire, where he cooked beautifully, though he did get a little scorched.
Mike came back without any bird, and he was delighted when he saw what I had done. He didn’t know that the bird was a crow, and I didn’t tell him; but he said it was a wild chicken and we would have a lovely breakfast.
67

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
When the crow was cooked, we divided him fairly with the jack-knife and sat down to breakfast. I never knew anything half so tough as that crow. It was just like india-rubber, only it didn’t taste as well. I ate one mouthful, and then I didn’t want any more. Mike said it was good when he first tried it, but after three mouthfuls he got up and went away into the woods, and when he came back he looked very pale and didn’t want to talk.
We couldn’t get along without some breakfast, and all at once I thought of frogs. We both went back to the stream where the bull caught us, and in a little while we had all the frogs we could carry. I cooked the hind-legs by frying them in the cover of the coffee-pot, only they were a good deal burned because I hadn’t any grease. But they were good, for all that; and though Mike wouldn’t eat them at first because he said he wasn’t any haythen Frenchman, he finished by eating more than I did.
After breakfast I told Mike that we couldn’t get on without some provisions, and that I would go to the nearest house and ask for something. He said that if I did the people would know I had run away the moment they saw me. “ I’ll go,” said he; “ nobody cares whether an Irish boy runs away or not, and they’ll be that glad to 68

get rid of me, that they’ll be after givin’ almost anythin’ in the line of cold vittles.” So off he went, and in an hour he came back with half a loaf of bread, a big piece of pork, a box of matches, and a flat piece of tin that he had picked up to use for a frying-pan. He said he had told the people that his poor mother was living in a hut about five miles up in the woods, and wanted some food and some matches to kindle a fire with; that she was bedridden, and neither he nor she had had anything to eat for two weeks. I explained to Mike that he had done wrong to tell what wasn’t true, and he seemed quite surprised, and told me that I mustn’t be after callin’ him a liar, for he couldn’t stand that same from anybody.
We were now ready to go on again, but Mike said he wasn’t going to stir until he got square with that bull, and Mike was so obstinate that you couldn’t reason with him. He undressed and covered himself all over with blue clay, till he looked like the most awful kind of blue ghost Then he hunted up the crow’s feathers, and tied a whole lot on his head and went after the bull. He found the wicked beast in his pasture, and when the bull saw him he stopped eating grass, and looked at Mike just as if he was saying, “ Goodness gracious! what on earth is that?” Mike went straight towards the bull, turning somersaults and cartwheels all the time, and yelling at

the top of his voice. The bull was frightened nearly out of his mind and started to run. Mike ran after him, and every time the bull looked at him he would turn somersaults again. He kept this up, and kept the bull running round the pasture, till the animal was so used up that he could hardly walk. Then Mike got a stick and laid it over that bull till he wished he had never been born. Mike was awfully tired when he got back to the camp, but he was in splendid spirits. I think it served the bull right, for he had no business to try to kill us, and to spoil Mike’s shirt, and keep us all day in a tree among the mosquitoes just because we had joked a little with him. I don’t like to see an animal cruelly treated, but I was glad to see Mike teach that bull a valuable lesson.
Mike was so tired that, after he had washed some of the blue clay off and put on his clothes, he proposed that we should stop all night where we were and have another feast of frogs’ legs, and as I was a little tired myself I agreed to it. We had a splendid supper, for this time we had a frying-pan and some pork to fry with, and Mike could fry beautifully. We made a sort of tent that night with branches, and as we kept the fire burning we had a comfortable sleep.
It was the next day, along in the afternoon, that we came to Rattlesnake Mountain. It looked close by when 70

L used to look at it from Mr. Travers’s yard, but it must have been ever so far away. We had to go straight over the mountain, and when we got to it we found that the side towards West Thompsonville was a tremendous great rock a hundred times as high as a house. We didn’t want to go round the mountain, for fear of losing our way, so we said we’d climb straight up the rock.
It wasn’t a very hard climb at first, but after a while the rock seemed to get smoother and straighter, and climbing it was a good deal worse than climbing up a steep roof, by getting your fingers under the shingles. We passed three or four places where we were just able to climb up, but where I knew we could never climb down again without falling. It was dreadfully hard work to carry the things with us. We had tied them on our backs, but they kept swinging round and getting directly in our way.
The sun was shining right on our heads, and it was very hot work climbing. Besides, it was very hard on a fellow’s fingers to hold on by the very tips of them. Mike was a little ways ahead of me, and suddenly I heard him hurrah, and I looked up and he was gone. At first I thought he had fallen down the rock, but I couldn’t see why he should hurrah about it. Presently I saw him putting his head out of a hole in the rock, and when I
6	11

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
had climbed up to where he was I found him in the best cave that ever was made.
The door where you went into the cave was behind a piece of rock, so that you couldn’t see it till you were close to it. The cave was as high inside as a lecture-room and about twelve feet wide, and the bottom was all dry sand. It wasn’t a very deep cave, for as soon as our eyes got a little used to the darkness we could see the end of it. There was a little spring of very cold water at the end of the cave, and there were beautiful pieces of pointed rock that hung down from the roof and looked something like vanilla cream candy, only they were darker, and of course, being rock, they weren’t good to eat. We took a drink of water, and then lay down on the sandy floor to ^ rest.	।
I never heard of anything so perfectly lovely as that cave was. After a while we found another entrance at the back of the cave that wasn’t quite large enough to squeeze through, but we broke away the sides of it a little and climbed out, and found that we were in a sort of big crack in the mountain, up which we could walk to the top. When we went back we got a big stone, and fixed it so that after we had gone into the cave we could move the rock a little and shut up the back door.
Mike was so delighted that he didn’t want to go any 72

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe further. He said now that we had such a magnificent cave we should be fools not to live there and be a gang of robbers. It was a long ways to Europe, he said, and we should have a hard time getting there, and perhaps when we did get there we might find that father had gone, and that we would have to come all the way back again.
It was a tremendous temptation to me, I admit, but I wouldn’t consent to it. I told Mike that he must not say anything more about our being robbers, for we were going to Europe, and we were not going to do anything else.
Mike saw I was in earnest, and he didn’t say any more, but I could see he was terribly disappointed. He sat down by the door, and whistled awhile, and threw gravel stones, and kicked the side of the door as if he meant to wear the rock away. By-and-by he got up and yawned, and said he believed he’d take his cross-bow and go out and kill some game. He borrowed my knife, and I saw him cutting holes in a handkerchief that I had given him to tie round his neck; and when I asked him what he did it for he said that he meant to bring the game home in it. I thought this was a little queer, but I didn’t like to ask him too many questions just then. I felt sorry for him that he was disappointed because I wouldn’t be a robber, for I knew by the way I felt myself just how 73

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe disappointed he must feel; but there was no help for it. I was really and truly sorry that we had found the cave, for it did seem a great pity to have such a splendid cave and then not be able to do anything with it.

A FTER Mike had gone out for game, I went out of 21 the back door and up the mountain and got a load of firewood. I built a fire near the first door of the cave, and got a slice of pork ready to fry in case Mike should not find any game. I supposed he would not be gone very long, but he stayed away so long that I got so tremendously hungry that I fried the pork and ate my half of it, and left his in the frying-pan to keep hot. He never came back until after sunset, and then he was more tired and cross than I ever saw him before. He didn’t have any game with him, and he grumbled because he said the pork was dried up, though it had only been four hours or so on the fire.
After a while he told me where he had been. He had been so disappointed when I said I wouldn’t live in the cave and be a robber that he had resolved to go out and rob and capture somebody. He said he thought that if he brought a captive to the cave, and kept him to be ransomed for a thousand dollars, I would give up my plan

of going to Europe and would agree to be a gang. He was going to let me be captain of the gang, and to do anything if I would only agree to stay with him.
Mike found a road on the other side of the mountain, and he hid himself in the bushes close by the road with his handkerchief over his face, for he had cut two holes for his eyes in the handkerchief and made a mask of it. After a while he saw a man driving all alone in a small wagon, and when he came near Mike stepped out with his cross-bow and demanded his money or his life. He thought the man was dreadfully frightened, for he said, “ Don’t shoot,” and then got down out of the wagon and came up to Mike, holding his hands up over his head, as Mike ordered him to. But as soon as the man came near to Mike he caught him by the scruff of the neck, and took away his cross-bow, and pulled off his mask, and then burst out laughing. Mike was awfully angry, but he couldn’t get away from the man, who walked him up to the wagon and got out his whip, and after giving Mike a few cuts over the legs made him confess that this was his first robbery, and promise never to do so any more. Then the man said he was a doctor, and that he would give Mike a little medicine that would do him good, so he got a powder out of his saddle-bags and made Mike swallow it, and then gave him back his cross-bow and

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe drove off. Mike began to feel awfully sick almost directly, and he had to lie on the grass for an hour before he was able to start back to the cave. “ It’s enough of bein’ a robber I’ve had this day,” Mike said when he finished the story, “ and you’ll niver hear me say another wurrud about it.”
We slept in the cave that night; and the next day it rained hard, so we played jack-stones and shot at a mark all day. We ate up all the provisions at breakfast the next morning, and at noon, when we had reached the valley on the other side of the mountain, Mike had to go to a house to get some more, but he didn’t get anything but a bite from a big dog, who kept most of Mike’s trousers to remember him by. However, that day we did shoot something. Mike shot a robin, and I shot a nowl. We ate the robin, but the nowl was worse than the crow, though I can’t understand why, for a nowl is a big bird, almost as big as a chicken, and it can’t fly much better. It must be that it tastes bad because it is up all night and sleeps all day, which must be a very unhealthy way to live.
All this time we had walked in a pretty straight line towards New York, but we now came to a river that was wide and deep and had a very swift current. It was too wide for me to swim and carry my clothes with

me, and even Mike couldn’t swim it and carry every* thing.
There was no bridge and no houses within sight, and the river ran through the middle of a big meadow where there was no wood for us to make a raft out of. We couldn’t see very well how we were going to get across where we were, so we decided to follow down the bank of the river till we should come to a bridge or find a boat.
We walked, I should think, two miles without finding any bridge or any boat, when I thought of a plan for getting across the river without either. Indians, when they are on horseback and come to a river, always fasten their clothes on the horses and make them swim across the river, while they hold on to the horses’ tails. Now, there were a dozen cows in the field close to the river, and I told Mike we could make the cows swim and tow us while we held on to their tails.
Mike said he wondered he hadn’t thought of it himself, because his uncle Patrick once swam across the biggest river in Ireland by holding on to the tails of two pigs that he was driving to market. He thought it would be no end of fun to make the cows swim, so we caught two cows, for they were as tame as they could be, and tied all our things to their horns except the cross-bows, which we tied on our shoulders. Then we drove them

into the river, and held on to their tails with one hand, and stirred them up with a stick in the other hand. At first the cows tried to. turn around and get into the meadow again, hut we finally got them started across the stream.
About half-way over I lost my stick, and presently my cow turned back in spite of all I could do. The current was so swift that it had carried us a long way down stream, and although Mike was nearly across the river, the bank was so steep where he was that his cow couldn’t land, and the last I saw of him he and his cow were going around a bend in the river and heading straight down stream.
My cow was just as disagreeable as she could be; she objected to having me hold on to her tail, and every little while she would try to turn around and hook me; but she didn’t know enough to know that she couldn’t reach me unless I should let go of her tail, and that was what I didn’t intend to do, for then I should have been drowned. She swam all over the river, but finally she came to a place where the bank was low and sandy, on the side of the river that we had started from, and there she shook me loose and scrambled up and galloped off with all my clothes except the cross-bow.
I sat down on the sand where it was warm, and at 79

first I was going to cry, when I remembered that I wasn’t a girl, and that a man who was going to Europe alone with Mike Flanigan ought to be ashamed to cry. But I was not a bit happy. I had no clothes, nothing to eat, and no matches, and I was all alone, and it was almost time for the darkness to begin. I began to feel pretty cold, so I took off my cross-bow, which didn’t warm me at all, and scooped up the sand so as to cover myself all over with it, and resolved to stay where I was and wait for morning.
The mosquitoes couldn’t get at me through the sand, but there were little insects of some kind in the sand that were worse than mosquitoes. However, I didn’t dare to crawl out from under the sand, for fear I would freeze. I lay there and wondered if I should ever see Mike again, and what in the world I would do without clothes, and whether I hadn’t made a mistake in running away. I did have a good warm bed at Mr. Travers’s, but then we need something more than beds to make us happy.
I must have dropped asleep when I heard Mike calling me. He was close by me, though he didn’t know it, because I was all buried in the sand except my head, and he thought it was a stone, and he said he was just going to sit down on it when I jumped up.
Wasn’t I glad to see him, though! His cow had 80

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe turned round, too, and landed him about two miles below where I had landed. She was so tired that she couldn’t run away, so Mike was able to get all his clothes back from her, and the blanket that they were wrapped up in.
I have never had any confidence in cows since that day. People pretend that they are nice, good, gentle animals, but I know better. I don’t call an animal gentle that tries to turn around in the water and hook you, and I don’t think any animal that runs away with all your clothes is good.
There was one bit of good news that Mike brought, and that was that he had seen a bridge across the river just below where his cow had landed. I felt quite comfortable when I had wrapped the blanket around me and Mike and I had lain down close together and covered ourselves with sand. Mike kept on talking, but I went to sleep while he was saying that we would find my cow in the morning and make her give my things back.
When I woke up the sun was two or three hours high, and Mike was gone, but I knew he would come back again. He did come back, with all my clothes and as much provisions as he could carry.
He said he walked back up stream to where we launched the cows, and then he followed a cow path which led up to a farm-house where he saw my clothes hanging 81

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
on a clothes-line. He told the fanner that the cow had come along while I was in swimming, and had played with my clothes till she had got them all twisted around her horns. The farmer said it was the most wonderful thing he had ever heard of, and he wouldn’t have had it happen for anything. When he heard that I had slept out all night, and that Mike and I had nothing to eat, he took Mike into the kitchen and gave him a good breakfast, and then gave him an armful of provisions—enough to last us for three or four days. The farmer wanted to know where we lived, and where we were going, and all about it; and I am sorry to say that Mike told him a story that wasn’t true. He said that we were brothers, and that we lived about a hundred miles up the river, and had come away from home because we wanted to go to school, and that we were just walking along looking for a good school, and meant to stop as soon as we could find one. The farmer said we were good noble boys, and that he would come down to the river to see me in about an hour. “ So,” said Mike, “ we’d betther be after lavin’, for if ivir he sees you, Jimmy, he’ll know we’re only tramps, with niver a thought of goin’ to school.”
I was perfectly shocked at the awful story Mike had told, but there wasn’t any use in talking to him and telling him that it was wrong to tell what wasn’t true.
82

He would say, “ Thrue for you, Jimmy,” and “ You’re right, Jimmy, nobody ought never to tell no lies,” and “ There’s nothing I despises as much as a liar, and that’s the truth now ”; but for all that he’d tell just as many stories as if I had never talked to him.
We didn’t wait for the farmer, but as soon as I had eaten some breakfast we set out for the bridge that Mike had seen. We crossed it and found that just on the other side of the river there was a railroad station.
Now I wasn’t sorry that I had run away, and I was just as much resolved to go to Europe as ever; but what Mike said about our being tramps made me miserable. I hadn’t thought of it before, but the truth is we were really and truly tramps. We were walking over the country, sleeping out-doors, and begging food. When I began to see that I was nothing but a tramp, I didn’t like it. Mike couldn’t understand what troubled me. He said, “ Ain’t we havin’ lots of fun, and niver a bit of wurruk to do, and iio school to go to; and what more are you wantin’, you ongrateful young fellow ?” But then it was different with Mike, for no one had ever explained to him that it was not nice to beg.
When I came to put on the clothes that Mike Had got back from the cow, I found that my compass had dropped out of my pocket and was lost; and I told Mike that now >	83

the only way for us to get to New York would be to walk along the road, and ask directions from people every now and then. We were sitting under a tree in sight of the railroad station when I said this, and Mike replied, “ Let’s quit walkin’ and go by the railroad ”; and when I said that we hadn’t any money, he laughed and told me that we could go in a freight-car without paying a cent, for his uncle once travelled mornamillion miles that way. and had had an elegant time.

I WASN’T quite sure that the railroad that Mike wanted to travel by went to New York, and I said we must be sure of it before we made up our minds to give up walking. But Mike said that railroads always went to New York, and if I felt uneasy about it he would go to the station and ask the man about it. Then I told him that I didn’t want to travel with my cross-bow, for I had heard that people were sometimes arrested and put in prison for travelling with arms in their hands, and that I wouldn’t throw it away on any account. Mike said I needn’t throw it away, for I could take the bow out and hide it under my shirt till I got into the car, and then I could put the bow in again and be ready to shoot robbers if they should attack us. What really made me willing to travel by the railroad was that it would take us to New York in a few hours, and that we wouldn’t have to beg for food and wouldn’t be tramps. I didn’t know then that tramps often travelled in freight-cars just as Mike and I intended to do.	.

Mike went down to the station and asked a switchman, in a sort of careless way, if that railroad went to New York, and the switchman said, “ Yes, thishyer railroad does go to New York, but there ain’t no palace-car on the train to-night, and you’d better telegraph to Mr. Vanderbilt and tell him you’re coming, so as he’ll send one up for you.” Mike didn’t waste time talking with the man, but he walked along by a freight-train that was standing on a side track, though there wasn’t any engine fastened to it, and he saw that there was an empty car with the door standing half-way open. He came back and told me that we could go and hide in the car, and that if it didn’t start before morning we needn’t mind, for we could sleep in the car as comfortably as if it was a house.
So I agreed to give up the plan of walking to New York, especially as the compass was lost and we couldn’t go across lots any more. We watched our chance when the railroad men went to dinner, and climbed into the car without anybody seeing us. Just then Mike remembered that we couldn’t get any water in the car, so he went out and filled our coffee-pot with water, and came very near being caught. After a while he went out again and came back with an armful of hay for a bed, and then he said that all we wanted was a lantern and some ice-
86

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
cream to be as well off as the president of the United States. He said his uncle, when he travelled morna-million miles on the railroad, had a great tin can full of ice-cream with him, and that he lived on it all the time. "You see, Jimmy,” he explained, “ice-crame is both vittels and dhrink, and that’s why my uncle always carried it.” I would give almost anything if I had known Mike’s uncle, for he must have been such an interesting and improving man.
We pulled to the door of the car, and wedged it so that it could not be easily pulled open from the outside. It was pretty dark inside, although there was a little window with an iron grating at one end; but after a while our eyes got used to the darkness and we could see very well. We spread the hay in one corner for a bed, and put the india-rubber piano-cover over it, and piled our things in a corner and thought we would take a nap, since we had nothing else to do.
We were waked up by a noise at the door of the car. Somebody was trying to open it, but couldn’t, and whoever it was grumbled and swore, till somebody called out to him that the car was all right and that he should hurry and lock it up. Then we heard the man lock the door, and knew that nobody would come to look for us before we should get to New York;

A little while afterwards the train started. We did not know what time it was, for it was pitch-dark when we woke up, but Mike said that he didn’t think it could be later than ten o’clock, for he didn’t feel as hungry as he always did if he woke up in the middle of the night. I didn’t like the car as much as I did before it started, for it shook us up as if we were in a wagon with the horses running away over a stony road, but we got used to it after a while. '
We had some supper, though it wasn’t very easy to find anything in the dark, and then went to bed for good. We stopped twice in the night, and we both woke up each time. I thought we had got to New York, but Mike said that if we had somebody would come and open the car, and that as long as nobody did come we could feel sure that we were only stopping at some small town.
When morning came the train was still jolting along. We could tell when it was daylight, but we could not see out so as to see where we were; so Mike cut a little hole in the side of the car with his jack-knife, which made a nice little window when you put your eye close to it, though it was only as big as a gimlet-hole. The window was very useful when we stopped at different stations, as we did about once an hour, for we could always tell by the looks of the place that it was not New York.

All that day the train was either going ahead or stopping at a station, and I couldn’t understand why it took us so long to get to New York. The car shook too much to let us play jack-stones, and there was nothing else that we could do. I said I wished the door was unlocked so that we could open it and have a little real daylight.
“It’s mighty lucky it’s locked,” said Mike, “else we might have a lot of dhirty tramps a-forcin’ their company on us.”
“ But,” said I, “ tramps walk. They don’t travel on the railroad.”
“ Oh, don’t they just!” replied Mike. “ Freight-cars is just full of tramps; that is, in the sayson, you understhand. Why, me uncle Bathrick once travelled in a car along with twinty-five as rigular tramps as ivir you saw.”
I said that I shouldn’t have thought that Mike’s uncle would have been willing to travel with tramps.
“ No more he wasn’t,” said Mike. “ He was travellin’ like a jintleman in his private freight-car, and he accidentally left his door open one night, and while he was ashlape these twinty-five tramps sneaked in on him and were beginnin’ to ate his ice-crame, when he waked up and just chucked iviry man of ’em out of the car door as aisy as me or you’d chuck out a crust of bread.”
I was awfully disappointed to find out that tramps

Digitized by LjOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe were in the habit of travelling in freight-cars, for one of the reasons why I agreed to travel in a freight-car was that I didn’t want to be a tramp any longer. But it often happens just that way, that when you don’t want to be a thing you’ve got to be it whatever you do.
When night came and the train was still going ahead I got really worried, but Mike wouldn’t admit that it was possible that the train was going anywhere except to New York. He said there were a great many different railroads, and some were longer than others, and probably we had found one of the long kind, but that it stood to reason we must get to New York sometime. He said we had a comfortable car and enough to eat and drink, and that it wasn’t worth while to worry till we got to New York, for when we did get there and the railroad men found us in the car they would give us something to worry about.
The little window at the end of the car was so high up that we couldn’t see anything out of it except sky. Sometime in the night I took hold of the window ledge and pulled myself up, so as to see if I could tell what time it was by looking at the moon. If you know how you can always tell the time by the moon. All you have to do is to look at the almanac and find out what time the moon rises* Then you look at your watch exactly an
90
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe hour after moonrise, and then look at the moon and see how many feet it has moved across the sky. If it has moved ten feet in the first hour it will move ten feet every other hour, so if you see that it has moved thirty feet you know it is three hours after moonrise. That is the way astronomers always find out what time it is at night.
There was once an astronomer who was always getting up in the night to look at the moon and find what time it was; and he made so much noise falling over chairs in the dark while he was looking for the matches that his wife said, “Why don’t you put your watch under the pillow and your matches on a chair close to the bed, and then when you want to know the time you can strike a match and look at your watch instead of getting up and falling over everything and monkeying with the moon and your foot-rule. Men are so stupid, anyway.” And the astronomer said, “My dear, you don’t know the first thing about astronomy, and you are talking nonsense.” But the next night when he got up to look at the moon he stepped on mornahundred tacks that his wife had accidentally spilt on the floor, and after he had got through having the lockjaw nothing could induce him ever to look at the moon again.
As I was saying, I pulled myself up to the window, 91
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
and the first thing I saw was a small rope hanging between our car and the next one. I caught hold of the rope and started to pull it in the window, thinking we could use it to tie up our bundles, when the engine gave an awful whistle and the train began to stop; so I let go the rope and dropped down to the floor of the car again. The train stopped, and we heard the trainmen run along the track and ask each other what was the matter, and swear, and make a terrible noise, and after a while the train started on again.
I wanted to get that rope, so I climbed up again and was pulling it in when the engine whistled again and the train stopped. There was another uproar among the trainmen, and I heard one of them say, “ It was a ghost,” though I didn’t know what he meant; another said, a It ain’t no ghosts; it’s tramps, that’s what it is.” Then I heard them unlocking the car doors, and I thought it was time to wake Mike up. By the time he was awake the men were unlocking our car door, and after they had pushed it open, which was hard work, because we had wedged it, one man held a lantern up and looked in. Mike and I stood close up in the corner, and the man never saw us; so he shut the door again, but was in such a hurry that he didn’t stop to lock it.
When I told Mike what had happened he told me that
92
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe the rope I had pulled was a signal cord, and that when a brakesman pulled it the engineer knew something dreadful was the matter, and stopped the train as quick as he could. Mike said it was a wonder that the men did not find us, and that if they had they would have half-killed us for meddling with the rope. Of course I should not have pulled it if I had known what it was; and after I understood what I had done I said to Mike that it ought to be a warning to him never to meddle; for more trouble is made by meddling than by almost anything else, except some other things.
I asked Mike why it wouldn’t be a good idea to pull the rope just as soon as we came in sight of New York, and then jump out as soon as the train stopped, and not wait for the trainmen to find us. He said it would, only if they saw us jumped run they would very likely fire at us. Once, so he said, his uncle stopped a train that way, and the men saw him and fired ever so many times at him, and mornfifty bullets hit him; but he wasn’t hurt any, because the men ^red at his legs so as to prevent him from running, and as he always wore a pair of Russia sheet-iron trousers the bullets couldn’t get through the iron. This shows what an ingenious man Mike’s uncle was to invent sheet-iron trousers. Every boy ought to have a pair, especially if he is liable to have a coolness 93

with, his father or his school-teacher. If I had worn sheet-iron trousers my legs would have escaped many a bitter pang, and I would never have needed to hunt up shingles and atlases, which, after all, hardly ever do any real good.

JUST before morning the train stopped again, and somebody carefully pushed the door open. We were both awake, and of course we kept as still as possible. Presently a man got into the car, and then two others followed him and shut the door. I thought they were the railroad men, and that they were going to do something terrible to us, but Mike whispered to me that they were tramps.
The men kept quiet until after the train had started, and then one of them lighted a candle and they saw us.
They looked like very bad men, and when they ordered Mike and me to get up and tell them who we were I was really frightened. Mike didn’t seem a bit frightened, and was as cheerful and friendly as if he had known the tramps all his life. He told them that we were sailors, and we had run away from our ship. The worst looking of the tramps asked if we had anything to eat, and made us give him the little bit of provisions that we had left. Then he ordered us to hand over all our things, and he
95
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe held me while another tramp took my dollar and eighteen cents away. After that they ordered us to go back to our corner of the car, and said that if we made the least noise, or offered to get up and look out while they were in the car, they would throw us under the wheels.
By-and-by the tramps took some bottles out of their pockets and began to drink. They made a good deal of noise at first, but after a while they became sleepy; and after two of them had had a fight, and rolled over each other and used dreadful swear-words, they all went sound asleep.
Mike and I let them sleep until we felt sure they wouldn’t wake up easily, and then we took some strings that we had tied our bundles up with, and a piece of rope that one of the tramps wore round his waist, and tied each man’s feet together, and tied the feet of one tramp to the hands of another and the waist of the third one. We wanted to tie all their feet together in a bunch, but they were lying in such a way that we could not do it without moving them. Then we took our things away from them, and while we were doing it we found that one of the tramps had a splendid gold watch in his pocket and a pair of bracelets that must have belonged to some rich lady.
Mike was very angry with the tramps, and I was a 96
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
little angry too, but I couldn’t help feeling more ashamed than anything else to think that we were almost as much tramps as they were. However, Mike said, “ We’ll tache ’em to get into railroad cars without lave, and to rob dacent travellers.” So at the next stopping-place Mike jumped out and called a brakesman, and told him that there were a lot of tramps in the freight-car. The tramps woke up almost as soon as Mike had gone, but as soon as they tried to get up they fell all over one another. The noise they made was perfectly dreadful, for each one thought the other was trying to trip him up, and so they tried to fight, but they were so tied up that they couldn’t do much.
I got out of the car as quick as I could, and just then Mike came up with four brakesmen. They were awfully astonished when they saw how the tramps were all twisted together, and found that they couldn’t disentangle them without cutting a lot of strings. When they finally got the tramps separated they tied their hands behind them, and after taking away the gold watch and the bracelets they locked them up in the car.
Then they wanted to know how we found the tramps and who tied them together. Mike began to tell one of his shocking stories, and I tried to interrupt him, but a brakesman gave me a slap on the ear and told me to be
97

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
quiet. Mike said that he and I were going to school, and stopped at the station to look at the train; and while we were there we heard men swearing in the freight-car, so we thought some bad men were trying to steal things in the car, and that we ought to tell the trainmen. Mike pretended that he didn’t have the least idea who tied the tramps together, but he thought likely that they tied themselves so that they would be sure not to fall out of the car door accidentally. As for riding in a freight-car, Mike said that we would never think of doing such a thing, and that our father, who was the governor of the state, would be very angry if we ever travelled in anything but a palace-car.
The men told Mike that he was a little liar, and laughed when he asked, very savagely, “Is it afther insultin’ me you are—doubtin’ me wurrud as if I was no betther than a brakesman?” Then they asked me how it all happened, and I told them the truth about our ride in the car and how the three tramps got in and robbed us. At first the trainmen thought they would tie us and lock us up with the tramps, but the conductor said that he believed one of the tramps was a man who had robbed a house a few nights before, near the place where they got on the train, and that there was a reward for his arrest. So he said that as we had done a good job in tying the 98
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
tramps and calling the brakesmen he would let us go, only the next time he caught us he would skin us alive and then put us in jail, where we would be sure to be hung. Then he told us to clear out, and the train started off and left us.
Mike was quite indignant at the trainmen for doubting his word, and said that they were no gentlemen, for no gentleman would ever tell another that what he said wasn’t true. So, just to get him in a better humor, I told him that people who travelled up high mountains, where the snow is mornahundred feet deep and just as hard and smooth on the top as ice, always tied themselves together with a rope; so that if one of them got tired and said he wouldn’t play and wanted to go home he couldn’t go, or if one of them fell down the rope would keep him from sliding away all by himself. It’s a good plan, too, for I tried it one winter when Aunt Eliza and her three little boys were visiting us. Mother had just been reading out loud about some men who tied themselves together and went up a very high mountain that was all covered with ice, and the next time we went out to slide down hill I thought I ought to tie Aunt Eliza’s boys together, for the hill was very steep and just as slippery as it could be. I tied them with their faces close together with the clothes-line, and wound it all around them, and
99

then gave them a little push, so that one of them would slip on the ice and I could see how the plan worked- It did work beautifully, for the three boys went down the hill like a streak of lightning, and there wasn’t the least chance that any one of them would break loose and slide off by himself and get frightened and lonesome. But, as usual, they were not pleased, and when I untied them at the bottom of the hill and showed them how to put snow on their noses to stop the bleeding, and told them to ask their mother to put court-plaster on their legs and arms, they just stood and cried and said I was mean and they would tell father—which I am sorry to say they did. That is the trouble in having anything to do with little boys, they haven’t sense enough to appreciate what you do for them. However, the experiment proved that it is an excellent thing to tie other people together when they travel up or down icy mountains.
We did not see any use in staying at the railroad station, and as we felt sure that New York must be very near we set out to walk to it along the railroad track. I wasn’t a bit sorry to walk, for I had got very tired of the freight-car. We had not walked more than two hours when we saw a large city a little way ahead of us which we knew must be New York.
We left the railroad track before we reached the city, 100
Digitized by Google
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe for we thought that perhaps we might meet the trainmen at the station, and Mike said that when a man had once called him a liar he didn’t feel any wish to see that man again.
We found that the city was even larger than we expected. It was as large as West Thompsonville, East Thompsonville, Thompsonville Centre, and Milltown all put together. We walked straight through it till we came to the river, and then we saw a tremendously big steamboat tied to the side of a wharf, while a crowd of men were putting barrels and boxes into her cellar. The smoke was coming out of her chimney, which made me think she was all ready to start I went up to a man who was standing by the door of the steamboat with a paper and pencil and keeping account of the number of barrels and boxes, and asked him if the steamboat was going to Europe. He looked at me a minute and then he said: “ Certainly. She goes to Europe every night at six o’clock and lands passengers at China and Africa on the way. You go right up to that big building yonder and get your ticket, and clear out from here and leave me alone.”
This was all I wanted to know; so I went back to Mike and told him it was all right and we had better go and get some breakfast. I was glad to find that it took only a night to go to Europe, for if the steamboat went 101

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
from New York to Europe every night, it stood to reason that she must get there in time to start back in the morning. Of course it wouldn’t be necessary for us to take any lunch with us on the steamboat, so' we thought we would spend eighteen cents of my money and Mike’s five cents in New York, and save the dollar till we got to Europe, in case there should be a circus there.
We had an elegant breakfast of pea-nuts and crackers; and then we had some more for dinner, and put some in our pockets for supper. We walked around the city all day and rode in the horse-cars, and saw the outside of a place where Barnum had his show, only the show had left town about a month before we got there* There was a great lot of steamboats in the river, but I don’t think all of them went to Europe, for I asked a man who was standing near one if it went to Europe, and he asked me if I was a fool, which was very rude, but it made me think that perhaps the boat didn’t go any farther than China or Africa.
About four o’clock we went down to the wharf, and lounged around there waiting for a chance to get on the steamboat without being seen. It was a long time before we got a chance, but at last when there was nobody in sight we slipped in at the door of the steamboat and found a little empty room just large enough for us and 102

with a lock on the door. There was a bookcase with two shelves on one side of the room, but instead of books the shelves had beds on them all made up with white sheets and pillows.
We locked the door, and thought we were awfully lucky to have real beds where we could sleep all the way to Europe. I told Mike I was afraid the captain of the boat would be dreadfully angry if he found us in a room that was very likely the spare bedroom, but he said it wouldn’t make any difference if he was; that he couldn’t kill us, and that if we once got to Europe he wouldn’t offer to take us back free. So we ate our pea-nuts, and lay down on the beds and waited for the boat to start.
She started at six o’clock, and about an hour afterwards she began to rock like a cradle, only she rocked in every direction. At first I thought it was fun, but before long I became dreadfully sick, and thought I should die. I supposed it was because I had eaten too many pea-nuts, for I knew that sometimes too many pea-nuts would make any one sick, because I knew a boy who once ate only a little over five quarts, and he very nearly died. But Mike, who was just as sick as I was, said it was only seasickness, and that ’most everybody had it who went to sea, but that it wasn’t dangerous and we’d get over it in a little while.

I kept feeling sicker and sicker instead of getting over it, and when, after an hour more, somebody came and tried to open our door, and asked, “Who’s in there?” and then told somebody else to get an axe, I was too sick to do anything except tell Mike that somebody was going to break the door open, and he was too sick to do anything except say, “ Let ’em.” But we couldn’t help but let them break open the door, which they did very easily, and then a big man hauled me off the shelf by the collar, while another man held a lantern and grinned.
The man who hauled me out said some dreadful things to me, and then handed me over to the other man while he hauled Mike out. Then, picking up our bundles, the men dragged us upstairs to the roof of the boat, where the captain was. I supposed they would throw us both into the water, but I was so sick that I didn’t care much.
The captain asked the man who found us a few questions, and then said, “Put them both ashore; we’ll be up to the island in ten minutes.” I was very glad to know we were going to leave the boat and get on solid ground again, but I didn’t like being put ashore in Africa or China. However, we were on our way to Europe, and as I knew there were missionaries in Africa and China, I thought that very likely they would help us.

N a few minutes the steamboat stopped, and a little boat was lowered into the water, and two sailors and the man who found Mike and me got into it. Then our bundles were thrown into the boat, and we were ordered to get into it, which, of course, we did, for we couldn’t help ourselves. The man who found us kept growling at us and calling us names, while the other sailors rowed the boat, but we didn’t feel like answering or doing anything but lying down and dying. Presently the boat came to a sandy beach, with big trees close to it, and the man ordered us to wade ashore. Then the boat went back to the steamboat, and the steamboat went puffing away to Europe.
We lay down on the sand for a long while, because we felt too sick to sit up or talk, and I would have given a good deal if I had been in my room at Mr. Travers’s. However, we went to sleep after a while, and woke up after daylight, feeling all right and very hungry.
I supposed we must be either in Africa or China, or 105

me, and even Mike couldn’t swim it and carry every* thing.
There was no bridge and no houses within sight, and the river ran through the middle of a big meadow where there was no wood for us to make a raft out of. We couldn’t see very well how we were going to get across where we were, so we decided to follow down the bank of the river till we should come to a bridge or find a boat.
We walked, I should think, two miles without finding any bridge or any boat, when I thought of a plan for getting across the river without either. Indians, when they are on horseback and come to a river, always fasten their clothes on the horses and make them swim across the river, while they hold on to the horses’ tails. Now, there were a dozen cows in the field close to the river, and I told Mike we could make the cows swim and tow us while we held on to their tails.
Mike said he wondered he hadn’t thought of it himself, because his uncle Patrick once swam across the biggest river in Ireland by holding on to the tails of two pigs that he was driving to market. He thought it would be no end of fun to make the cows swim, so we caught two cows, for they were as tame as they could be, and tied all our things to their horns except the cross-bows, which we tied on our shoulders. Then we drove them

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe into the river, and held on to their tails with one hand, and stirred them up with a stick in the other hand. At first the cows tried to. turn around and get into the meadow again, but we finally got them started across the stream.
About half-way over I lost my stick, and presently my cow turned back in spite of all I could do. The current was so swift that it had carried us a long way down stream, and although Mike was nearly across the river, the bank was so steep where he was that his cow couldn’t land, and the last I saw of him he and his cow were going around a bend in the river and heading straight down stream.
My cow was just as disagreeable as she could be; she objected to having me hold on to her tail, and every little while she would try to turn around and hook me; but she didn’t know enough to know that she couldn’t reach me unless I should let go of her tail, and that was what I didn’t intend to do, for then I should have been drowned. She swam all over the river, but finally she came to a place where the bank was low and sandy, on the side of the river that we had started from, and there she shook me loose and scrambled up and galloped off with all my clothes except the cross-bow.
I sat down on the sand where it was warm, and at 79

first I was going to cry, when I remembered that I wasn’t a girl, and that a man who was going to Europe alone with Mike Flanigan ought to be ashamed to cry. But I was not a bit happy. I had no clothes, nothing to eat, and no matches, and I was all alone, and it was almost time for the darkness to begin. I began to feel pretty cold, so I took off my cross-bow, which didn’t warm me at all, and scooped up the sand so as to cover myself all over with it, and resolved to stay where I was and wait for morning.
The mosquitoes couldn’t get at me through the sand, but there were little insects of some kind in the sand that were worse than mosquitoes. However, I didn’t dare to crawl out from under the sand, for fear I would freeze. I lay there and wondered if I should ever see Mike again, and what in the world I would do without clothes, and whether I hadn’t made a mistake in running away. I did have a good warm bed at Mr. Travers’s, but then we need something more than beds to make us happy.
I must have dropped asleep when I heard Mike calling me. He was close by me, though he didn’t know it, because I was all buried in the sand except my head, and he thought it was a stone, and he said he was just going to sit down on it when I jumped up.
Wasn’t I glad to see him, though! His cow had 80

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe turned round, too, and landed him about two miles below where I had landed. She was so tired that she couldn’t run away, so Mike was able to get all his clothes back from her, and the blanket that they were wrapped up in.
I have never had any confidence in cows since that day. People pretend that they are nice, good, gentle animals, but I know better. I don’t call an animal gentle that tries to turn around in the water and hook you, and I don’t think any animal that runs away with all your clothes is good.
There was one bit of good news that Mike brought, and that was that he had seen a bridge across the river just below where his cow had landed. I felt quite comfortable when I had wrapped the blanket around me and Mike and I had Iain down close together and covered ourselves with sand. Mike kept on talking, but I went to sleep while he was saying that we would find my cow in the morning and make her give my things back.
When I woke up the sun was two or three hours high, and Mike was gone, but I knew he would come back again. He did come back, with all my clothes and as much provisions as he could carry.
He said he walked back up stream to where we launched the cows, and then he followed a cow path which led up to a farm-house where he saw my clothes hanging 81

on a clothes-line. He told the fanner that the cow had come along while I was in swimming, and had played with my clothes till she had got them all twisted around her horns. The farmer said it was the most wonderful thing he had ever heard of, and he wouldn’t have had it happen for anything. When he heard that I had slept out all night, and that Mike and I had nothing to eat, he took Mike into the kitchen and gave him a good breakfast, and then gave him an armful of provisions—enough to last us for three or four days. The farmer wanted to know where we lived, and where we were going, and all about it; and I am sorry to say that Mike told him a story that wasn’t true. He said that we were brothers, and that we lived about a hundred miles up the river, and had come away from home because we wanted to go to school, and that we were just walking along looking for a good school, and meant to stop as soon as we could find one. The farmer said we were good noble boys, and that he would come down to the river to see me in about an hour. “ So,” said Mike, “ we’d betther be after lavin’, for if ivir he sees you, Jimmy, he’ll know we’re only tramps, with niver a thought of goin’ to school.”
I was perfectly shocked at the awful story Mike had told, but there wasn’t any use in talking to him and telling him that it was wrong to tell what wasn’t true.

He would say, “ Thrue for you, Jimmy,” and K You’re right, Jimmy, nobody ought never to tell no lies,” and “ There’s nothing I despises as much as a liar, and that’s the truth now ”; but for all that he’d tell just as many stories as if I had never talked to him.
We didn’t wait for the farmer, but as soon as I had eaten some breakfast we set out for the bridge that Mike had seen. We crossed it and found that just on the other side of the river there was a railroad station.
Now I wasn’t sorry that I had run away, and I was just as much resolved to go to Europe as ever; but what Mike said about our being tramps made me miserable. I hadn’t thought of it before, but the truth is we were really and truly tramps. We were walking over the country, sleeping out-doors, and begging food. When I began to see that I was nothing but a tramp, I didn’t like it. Mike couldn’t understand what troubled me. He said, “ Ain’t we havin’ lots of fun, and niver a bit of wurruk to do, and no school to go to; and what more are you wantin’, you ongrateful young fellow ?” But then it was different with Mike, for no one had ever explained to him that it was not nice to beg.
When I came to put on the clothes that Mike Ead got back from the cow, I found that my compass had dropped out of my pocket and was lost; and I told Mike that now

the only way for us to get to New York would be to walk along the road, and ask directions from people every now and then. We were sitting under a tree in sight of the railroad station when I said this, and Alike replied, “ Let’s quit walkin’ and go by the railroad ”; and when I said that we hadn’t any money, he laughed and told me that we could go in a freight-car without paying a cent, for his uncle once travelled mornamillion miles that way. and had had an elegant time.

I WASN’T quite sure that the railroad that Mike wanted to travel by went to New York, and I said we must be sure of it before we made up our minds to give up walking. But Mike said that railroads always went to New York, and if I felt uneasy about it he would go to the station and ask the man about it. Then I told him that I didn’t want to travel with my cross-bow, for I had heard that people were sometimes arrested and put in prison for travelling with arms in their hands, and that I wouldn’t throw it away on any account. Mike said I needn’t throw it away, for I could take the bow out and hide it under my shirt till I got into the car, and then I could put the bow in again and be ready to shoot robbers if they should attack us. What really made me willing to travel by the railroad was that it would take us to New York in a few hours, and that we wouldn’t have to beg for food and wouldn’t be tramps. I didn’t know then that tramps often travelled in freight-cars just as Mike and I intended to do.

Mike went down to the station and asked a switchman, in a sort of careless way, if that railroad went to New York, and the switchman said, u Yes, thishyer railroad does go to New York, but there ain’t no palace-car on the train to-night, and you’d better telegraph to Mr. Vanderbilt and tell him you’re coming, so as he’ll send one up for you.” Mike didn’t waste time talking with the man, but he walked along by a freight-train that was standing on a side track, though there wasn’t any engine fastened to it, and he saw that there was an empty car with the door standing half-way open. He came back and told me that we could go and hide in the car, and that if it didn’t start before morning we needn’t mind, for we could sleep in the car as comfortably as if it was a house.
So I agreed to give up the plan of walking to New York, especially as the compass was lost and we couldn’t go across lots any more. We watched our chance when the railroad men went to dinner, and climbed into the car without anybody seeing us. Just then Mike remembered that we couldn’t get any water in the car, so he went out and filled our coffee-pot with water, and came very near being caught. After a while he went out again and came back with an armful of hay for a bed, and then he said that all we wanted was a lantern and some ice-86

cream to be as well off as the president of the United States. He said his uncle, when he travelled morna-million miles on the railroad, had a great tin can full of ice-cream with him, and that he lived on it all the time. “ You see, Jimmy,” he explained, “ ice-crame is both vittels and dhrink, and that’s why my uncle always carried it.” I would give almost anything if I had known Mike’s uncle, for he must have been such an interesting and improving man.
We pulled to the door of the car, and wedged it so that it could not be easily pulled open from the outside. It was pretty dark inside, although there was a little window with an iron grating at one end; but after a while our eyes got used to the darkness and we could see very well. We spread the hay in one corner for a bed, and put the india-rubber piano-cover over it, and piled our things in a corner and thought we would take a nap, since we had nothing else to do.
We were waked up by a noise at the door of the car. Somebody was trying to open it, but couldn’t, and whoever it was grumbled and swore, till somebody called out to him that the car was all right and that he should hurry and lock it up. Then we heard the man lock the door, and knew that nobody would come to look for us before we should get to New York;

A little while afterwards the train started. We did not know what time it was, for it was pitch-dark when we woke up, but Mike said that he didn’t think it could be later than ten o’clock, for he didn’t feel as hungry as he always did if he woke up in the middle of the night. I didn’t like the car as much as I did before it started, for it shook us up as if we were in a wagon with the horses running away over a stony road, but we got used to it after a while. '
We had some supper, though it wasn’t very easy to find anything in the dark, and then went to bed for good. We stopped twice in the night, and we both woke up each time. I thought we had got to New York, but Mike said that if we had somebody would come and open the car, and that as long as nobody did come we could feel sure that we were only stopping at some small town.
When morning came the train was still jolting along. We could tell when it was daylight, but we could not see out so as to see where we were; so Mike cut a little hole in the side of the car with his jack-knife, which made a nice little window when you put your eye close to it, though it was only as big as a gimlet-hole. The window was very useful when we stopped at different stations, as we did about once an hour, for we could always tell by the looks of the place that it was not New York.

All that day the train was either going ahead or stopping at a station, and I couldn’t understand why it took us so long to get to New York. The car shook too much to let us play jack-stones, and there was nothing else that we could do. I said I wished the door was unlocked so that we could open it and have a little real daylight.
“ It’s mighty lucky it’s locked,” said Mike, “ else we might have a lot of dhirty tramps a-forcin’ their company on us.”
“ But,” said I, “ tramps walk. They don’t travel on the railroad.”
“ Oh, don’t they just!” replied Mike. “ Freight-cars is just full of tramps; that is, in the sayson, you understhand. Why, me uncle Bathrick once travelled in a car along with twinty-five as rigular tramps as ivir you saw.”
I said that I shouldn’t have thought that Mike’s uncle would have been willing to travel with tramps.
“No more he wasn’t,” said Mike. “He was travellin’ like a jintleman in his private freight-car, and he accidentally left his door open one night, and while he was ashlape these twinty-five tramps sneaked in on him and were heginnin’ to ate his ice-crame, when he waked up and just chucked iviry man of ’em out of the car door as aisy as me or you’d chuck out a crust of bread.”
I was awfully disappointed to find out that tramps

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe were in the habit of travelling in freight-care, for one of the reasons why I agreed to travel in a freight-car was that I didn’t want to he a tramp any longer. But it often happens just that way, that when you don’t want to be a thing you’ve got to be it whatever you do.
When night came and the train was still going ahead I got really worried, but Mike wouldn’t admit that it was possible that the train was going anywhere except to New York. He said there were a great many different railroads, and some were longer than others, and probably we had found one of the long kind, but that it stood to reason we must get to New York sometime. He said we had a comfortable car and enough to eat and drink, and that it wasn’t worth while to worry till we got to New York, for when we did get there and the railroad men found us in the car they would give us something to worry about.
The little window at the end of the car was so high up that we couldn’t see anything out of it except sky. Sometime in the night I took hold of the window ledge and pulled myself up, so as to see if I could tell what time it was by looking at the moon. If you know how you can always tell the time by the moon. All you have to do is to look at the almanac and find out what time the moon rises. Then you look at your watch exactly an 90
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe hour after moonrise, and then look at the moon and see how many feet it has moved across the sky. If it has moved ten feet in the first hour it will move ten feet every other hour, so if you see that it has moved thirty feet you know it is three hours after moonrise. That is the way astronomers always find out what time it is at night.
There was once an astronomer who was always getting up in the night to look at the moon and find what time it was; and he made so much noise falling over chairs in the dark while he was looking for the matches that his wife said, “Why don’t you put your watch under the pillow and your matches on a chair close to the bed, and then when you want to know the time you can strike a match and look at your watch instead of getting up and falling over everything and monkeying with the moon and your foot-rule. Men are so stupid, anyway.” And the astronomer said, “My dear, you don’t know the first thing about astronomy, and you are talking nonsense.” But the next night when he got up to look at the moon he stepped on mornahundred tacks that his wife had accidentally spilt on the floor, and after he had got through having the lockjaw nothing could induce him ever to look at the moon again.
As I was saying, I pulled myself up to the window, 91

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
and the first thing I saw was a small rope hanging between our car and the next one. I caught hold of the rope and started to pull it in the window, thinking we could use it to tie up our bundles, when the engine gave an awful whistle and the train began to stop; so I let go the rope and dropped down to the floor of the car again. The train stopped, and we heard the trainmen run along the track and ask each other what was the matter, and swear, and make a terrible noise, and after a while the train started on again.
I wanted to get that rope, so I climbed up again and was pulling it in when the engine whistled again and the train stopped. There was another uproar among the trainmen, and I heard one of them say, “ It was a ghost/’ though I didn’t know what he meant; another said, “ It ain’t no ghosts; it’s tramps, that’s what it is.” Then I heard them unlocking the car doors, and I thought it was time to wake Mike up. By the time he was awake the men were unlocking our car door, and after they had pushed it open, which was hard work, because we had wedged it, one man held a lantern up and looked in. Mike and I stood close up in the corner, and the man never saw us; so he shut the door again, but was in such a hurry that he didn’t stop to lock it.
When I told Mike what had happened he told me that
92
Digitized by Google
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe the rope I had pulled was a signal cord, and that when a brakesman pulled it the engineer knew something dreadful was the matter, and stopped the train as quick as he could. Mike said it was a wonder that the men did not find us, and that if they had they would have half-killed us for meddling with the rope. Of course I should not have pulled it if I had known what it was; and after I understood what I had done I said to Mike that it ought to be a warning to him never to meddle; for more trouble is made by meddling than by almost anything else, except some other things.
I asked Mike why it wouldn’t be a good idea to pull the rope just as soon as we came in sight of New York, and then jump out as soon as the train stopped, and not wait for the trainmen to find us. He said it would, only if they saw us jump'and run they would very likely fire at us. Once, so he said, his uncle stopped a train that way, and the men saw him and fired ever so many times at him, and mornfifty bullets hit him; but he wasn’t hurt any, because the men ^red at his legs so as to prevent him from running, and as he always wore a pair of Russia sheet-iron trousers the bullets couldn’t get through the iron. This shows what an ingenious man Mike’s uncle was to invent sheet-iron trousers. Every boy ought to have a pair, especially if he is liable to have a coolness 93

with his father or his school-teacher. If I had worn sheet-iron trousers my legs would have escaped many a bitter pang, and I would never have needed to hunt up shingles and atlases, which, after all, hardly ever do any real good.

JUST before morning the train stopped again, and somebody carefully pushed the door open. We were both awake, and of course we kept as still as possible. Presently a man got into the car, and then two others followed him and shut the door. I thought they were the railroad men, and that they were going to do something terrible to us, but Mike whispered to me that they were tramps.
The men kept quiet until after the train had started, and then one of them lighted a candle and they saw us.
They looked like very bad men, and when they ordered Mike and me to get up and tell them who we were I was really frightened. Mike didn’t seem a bit frightened, and was as cheerful and friendly as if he had known the tramps all his life. He told them that we were sailors, and we had run away from our ship. The worst looking of the tramps asked if we had anything to eat, and made us give him the little bit of provisions that we had left. Then he ordered us to hand over all our things, and he 95
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe held me while another tramp took my dollar and eighteen cents away. After that they ordered us to go back to our corner of the car, and said that if we made the least noise, or offered to get up and look out while they were in the car, they would throw us under the wheels.
By-and-by the tramps took some bottles out of their pockets and began to drink. They made a good deal of noise at first, but after a while they became sleepy; and after two of them had had a fight, and rolled over each other and used dreadful swear-words, they all went sound asleep.
Mike and I let them sleep until we felt sure they wouldn’t wake up easily, and then we took some strings that we had tied our bundles up with, and a piece of rope that one of the tramps wore round his waist, and tied each man’s feet together, and tied the feet of one tramp to the hands of another and the waist of the third one. We wanted to tie all their feet together in a bunch, but they were lying in such a way that we could not do it without moving them. Then we took our things away from them, and while we were doing it we found that one of the tramps had a splendid gold watch in his pocket and a pair of bracelets that must have belonged to some rich lady.
Mike was very angry with the tramps, and I was a 96
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
little angry too, but I couldn’t help feeling more ashamed than anything else to think that we were almost as much tramps as they were. However, Mike said, “ We’ll tache ’em to get into railroad cars without lave, and to rob dacent travellers.” So at the next stopping-place Mike jumped out and called a brakesman, and told him that there were a lot of tramps in the freight-car. The tramps woke up almost as soon as Mike had gone, but as soon as they tried to get up they fell all over one another. The noise they made was perfectly dreadful, for each one thought the other was trying to trip him up, and so they tried to fight, but they were so tied up that they couldn’t do much.
I got out of the car as quick as I could, and just then Mike came up with four brakesmen. They were awfully astonished when they saw how the tramps were all twisted together, and found that they couldn’t disentangle them without cutting a lot of strings. When they finally got the tramps separated they tied their hands behind them, and after taking away the gold watch and the bracelets they locked them up in the car.
Then they wanted to know how we found the tramps and who tied them together. Mike began to tell one of his shocking stories, and I tried to interrupt him, but a brakesman gave me a slap on the ear and told me to be
97

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
quiet. Mike said that he and I were going to school, and stopped at the station to look at the train; and while we were there we heard men swearing in the freight-car, so we thought some bad men were trying to steal things in the car, and that we ought to tell the trainmen. Mike pretended that he didn’t have the least idea who tied the tramps together, but he thought likely that they tied themselves so that they would be sure not to fall out of the car door accidentally. As for riding in a freight-car, Mike said that we would never think of doing such a thing, and that our father, who was the governor of the state, would be very angry if we ever travelled in anything but a palace-car.
The men told Mike that he was a little liar, and laughed when he asked, very savagely, “Is it afther insultin’ me you are—doubtin’ me wurrud as if I was no betther than a brakesman ?” Then they asked me how it all happened, and I told them the truth about our ride in the car and how the three tramps got in and robbed us. At first the trainmen thought they would tie us and lock us up with the tramps, but the conductor said that he believed one of the tramps was a man who had robbed a house a few nights before, near the place where they got on the train, and that there was a reward for his arrest. So he said that as we had done a good job in tying the 98
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe tramps and calling the brakesmen he would let us go, only the next time he caught us he would skin us alive and then put us in jail, where we would be sure to be hung. Then he told us to clear out, and the train started off and left us.
Mike was quite indignant at the trainmen for doubting his word, and said that they were no gentlemen, for no gentleman would ever tell another that what he said wasn’t true. So, just to get him in a better humor, I told him that people who travelled up high mountains, where the snow is mornahundred feet deep and just as hard and smooth on the top as ice, always tied themselves together with a rope; so that if one of them got tired and said he wouldn’t play and wanted to go home he couldn’t go, or if one of them fell down the rope would keep him from sliding away all by himself. It’s a good plan, too, for I tried it one winter when Aunt Eliza and her three little boys were visiting us. Mother had just been reading out loud about some men who tied themselves together and went up a very high mountain that was all covered with ice, and the next time we went out to slide down hill I thought I ought to tie Aunt Eliza’s boys together, for the hill was very steep and just as slippery as it could be. I tied them with their faces close together with the clothes-line, and wound it all around them, and
99
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
then gave them a little push, so that one of them would slip on the ice and I could see how the plan worked. It did work beautifully, for the three boys went down the hill like a streak of lightning, and there wasn’t the least chance that any one of them would break loose and slide off by himself and get frightened and lonesome. But, as usual, they were not pleased, and when I untied them at the bottom of the hill and showed them how to put snow on their noses to stop the bleeding, and told them to ask their mother to put court-plaster on their legs and arms, they just stood and cried and said I was mean and they would tell father—which I am sorry to say they did. That is the trouble in having anything to do with little boys, they haven’t sense enough to appreciate what you do for them. However, the experiment proved that it is an excellent thing to tie other people together when they travel up or down icy mountains.
We did not see any use in staying at the failroad station, and as we felt sure that New York must be very near we set out to walk to it along the railroad track. I wasn’t a bit sorry to walk, for I had got very tired of the freight-car. We had not walked more than two hours when we saw a large city a little way ahead of us which we knew must be New York.
We left the railroad track before we reached the city, 100

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe for we thought that perhaps we might meet the trainmen at the station, and Mike said that when a man had once called him a liar he didn’t feel any wish to see that man again.
We found that the city was even larger than we expected. It was as large as West Thompsonville, East Thompsonville, Thompsonville Centre, and Milltown all put together. We walked straight through it till we came to the river, and then we saw a tremendously big steamboat tied to the side of a wharf, while a crowd of men were putting barrels and boxes into her cellar. The smoke was coming out of her chimney, which made me think she was all ready to start. I went up to a man who was standing by the door of the steamboat with a paper and pencil and keeping account of the number of barrels and boxes, and asked him if the steamboat was going to Europe. He looked at me a minute and then he said: “ Certainly. She goes to Europe every night at six o’clock and lands passengers at China and Africa on the way. You go right up to that big building yonder and get your ticket, and clear out from here and leave me alone.”
This was all I wanted to know; so I went back to Mike and told him it was all right and we had better go and get some breakfast. I was glad to find that it took only a night to go to Europe, for if the steamboat went 101

from New York to Europe every night, it stood to reason that she must get there in time to start back in the morning. Of course it wouldn’t be necessary for us to take any lunch with us on the steamboat, so' we thought we would spend eighteen cents of my money and Mike’s five cents in New York, and save the dollar till we got to Europe, in case there should be a circus there.
We had an elegant breakfast of pea-nuts and crackers; and then we had some more for dinner, and put some in our pockets for supper. We walked around the city all day and rode in the horse-cars, and saw the outside of a place where Barnum had his show, only the show had left town about a month before we got there. There was a great lot of steamboats in the river, but I don’t think all of them went to Europe, for I asked a man who was standing near one if it went to Europe, and he asked me if I was a fool, which was very rude, but it made me think that perhaps the boat didn’t go any farther than China or Africa.
About four o’clock we went down to the wharf, and lounged around there waiting for a chance to get on the steamboat without being seen. It was a long time before we got a chance, but at last when there was nobody in sight we slipped in at the door of the steamboat and found a little empty room just large enough for us and 102

with a lock on the door. There was a bookcase with two shelves on one side of the room, but instead of books the shelves had beds on them all made up with white sheets and pillows.
We locked the door, and thought we were awfully lucky to have real beds where we could sleep all the way to Europe. I told Mike I was afraid the captain of the boat would be dreadfully angry if he found us in a room that was very likely the spare bedroom, but he said it wouldn’t make any difference if he was; that he couldn’t kill us, and that if we once got to Europe he wouldn’t offer to take us back free. So we ate our pea-nuts, and lay down on the beds and waited for the boat to start.
She started at six o’clock, and about an hour afterwards she began to rock like a cradle, only she rocked in every direction. At first I thought it was fun, but before long I became dreadfully sick, and thought I should die. I supposed it was because I had eaten too many pea-nuts, for I knew that sometimes too many pea-nuts would make any one sick, because I knew a boy who once ate only a little over five quarts, and he very nearly died. But Mike, who was just as sick as I was, said it was only seasickness, and that ’most everybody had it who went to sea, but that it wasn’t dangerous and we’d get over it in a little while.

I kept feeling sicker and sicker instead of getting over it, and when, after an hour more, somebody came and tried to open our door, and asked, “ Who’s in there ?” and then told somebody else to get an axe, I was too sick to do anything except tell Mike that somebody was going to break the door open, and he was too sick to do anything except say, “Let ’em.” But we couldn’t help but let them break open the door, which they did very easily, and then a big man hauled me off the shelf by the collar, while another man held a lantern and grinned.
The man who hauled me out said some dreadful things to me, and then handed me over to the other man while he hauled Mike out. Then, picking up our bundles, the men dragged us upstairs to the roof of the boat, where the captain was. I supposed they would throw us both into the water, but I was so sick that I didn’t care much.
The captain asked the man who found us a few questions, and then said, “Put them both ashore; we’ll be up to the island in ten minutes.” I was very glad to know we were going to leave the boat and get on solid ground again, but I didn’t like being put ashore in Africa or China. However, we were on our way to Europe, and as I knew there were missionaries in Africa and China, I thought that very likely they would help us.

IN a few minutes the steamboat stopped, and a little boat was lowered into the water, and two sailors and the man who found Mike and me got into it. Then our bundles were thrown into the boat, and we were ordered to get into it, which, of course, we did, for we couldn’t help ourselves. The man who found us kept growling at us and calling us names, while the other sailors rowed the boat, but we didn’t feel like answering or doing anything but lying down and dying. Presently the boat came to a sandy beach, with big trees close to it, and the man ordered us to wade ashore. Then the boat went back to the steamboat, and the steamboat went puffing away to Europe.
We lay down on the sand for a long while, because we felt too sick to sit up or talk, and I would have given a good deal if I had been in my room at Mr. Travers’s. However, we went to sleep after a while, and woke up after daylight, feeling all right and very hungry.
I supposed we must be either in Africa or China, or 105

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe some place like New Zealand or India. I looked at the trees to see if they had cocoa-nuts or monkeys on them, but they looked exactly like our trees at home. We could see land a long distance off across the water, and we supposed it was probably America. As we had no breakfast, for all our pea-nuts were gone, I told Mike that we must try to find some missionaries or some friendly natives and ask them for breakfast.
We had a good swim in the ocean, which didn’t taste salt at all, though I had always heard that it was salt like some kinds of medicine, but I remembered that I had read that near the mouths of large rivers the ocean tastes like cistern-water. After our swim we got out our crossbows and put them together, and started into the woods to search for human beings.
I asked Mike if his uncle was ever shipwrecked on an uninhabited island or among savages, and, if so, how did he get anything to eat. He said that his uncle had been shipwrecked lots of times, and he particularly remembered how once Uncle Patrick was cast ashore on an uninhabited island that was full of savages of a dark-blue color, without any clothes except gold watch-chains, which they wore round their waists. At first they were going to kill him and eat him, but he told them by signs that he had the cholera, and that they couldn’t eat him without 106

being very sick. He had swum ashore with a breechloading rifle on his back, and while he was talking with the savages he saw an eagle about five miles up in the air, and shot it. The savages all fell on their faces with fright when they heard the gun, and after they saw that the eagle was killed they made Mike’s uncle king, with a salary of a million dollars, and built him an elegant palace, and gave him two thousand wives and a thousand horses, and all kinds of dogs, and more slaves to do his work for him than he could count. He lived for three or four years on the island, and then grew tired of it, so he built a boat, and one night he sailed away when everybody was asleep, and was picked up by a ship and brought to America. As we didn’t happen to have a breech-loading rifle with us we couldn’t expect to do what his uncle did, but just then we came to a place where there was no end of raspberry-bushes, so that we had the very best kind of breakfast. ,
Of course we kept a sharp lookout all this time for lions and tigers and other wild beasts, but we saw nothing except some squirrels, which looked just like our squirrels, and a striped snake that got away before we could kill it. We didn’t try to shoot the squirrels, because we needed to save our arrows, in case we should have to fight the savages.

After we had eaten all the raspberries we wanted, we marched on through the woods, being very careful not to tread on dry branches, or anything that might make a noise and alarm the natives. It was not long before we came to a hill, and when we had climbed to the top we saw that we were on a small island.
Now New Zealand is an island, and I told Mike that we had probably been put ashore on New Zealand, and that the natives were cannibals, and would be pretty sure to kill us unless we could find a missionary who would protect us. We could see no signs of any inhabitants except at one end of the island, where we saw a little smoke, which showed that somebody had kindled a fire. We wanted to find out if this was a heathen or a missionary fire, so we resolved to creep up close enough to it to find out what kind of a fire it was.
On the way we suddenly came across a little foot-path through the woods, where we could see the tracks of some animal. I thought it might be the tracks of a rhinoceros, but Mike said they were made by cows. I had never heard that there were cows in New Zealand, but I knew that the African native kings had lots of them, so I began to think that perhaps we were on some island close to Africa. I wished then that I had studied geography more carefully, and I told Mike that 108
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe he had done very wrong not to have learned his geography lessons perfectly.
We did not dare to walk in the path, for fear of meeting the natives, so we kept a few yards on one side of the path. By-and-by we heard a footstep. We crouched down where we could see the path without being seen ourselves, and we saw a little native. He was an African, sure enough, and he had no clothes except a ragged little shirt and a pair of old trousers. This made me sure that we were in Africa or close to it, and I told Mike that the boy would not have worn a shirt and trousers unless there were missionaries to show him how to put them on.
We felt very much encouraged to find that we were in a place where there were missionaries, and I resolved that I would never again grudge giving money to missionaries, though sometimes when somebody gives you fifty cents and the grown-up folks say, “ Now, Jimmy, I’m sure you want to give half of it to the missionaries,” you don’t always want to do, especially when you know you’ve got to do or else people will look as if they thought you were as selfish as anything.
We didn’t meet any more natives till we got near enough to the smoke to see that it came from a fire built on the beach. But not far from the fire we saw a log

house, which I thought must belong to the missionaries, because the native Africans don’t know enough to build anything but huts. I was just going boldly up to knock at the front door when I saw an old native come out with a fishing-pole and a basket.
This looked as if, after all, the house belonged to the natives, so I told Mike we would watch a little longer and try and find out what sort of people the natives who lived in the house were. The old man went down to the shore and sat down behind a rock to fish, where he couldn’t see us, though we could see the top of his head.
We waited about ten minutes, when another boy about ten years old came out and sat down by the fire, and amused himself by throwing little chips and pieces of burnt wood into the blaze. I was so tired and anxious that I resolved to speak to the boy and find out where we were; so I told Mike to be ready to rush out and help me in case I should be attacked, and I walked straight up to the boy and began to make signs that I was friendly and wanted something to eat, just as the savages in Bobinson Crusoe used to make signs.
' The boy stood with his mouth open for a few minutes, and then he gave an awful yell and ran into the house. A native woman, who was probably his mother, came to the door and looked out, but by this time I had jumped 110

Mike now proposed that we should steal up behind the old man who was fishing, and if we found him friendly we would be friendly, and if he was hostile we could shoot him quietly without alarming the rest of the natives. He said his uncle, when he was in Africa, where he once landed all alone to bury a box of gold and silver that he hadn’t any room for in his ship, captured a king who was fishing and didn’t see him until Mike’s uncle had caught him by the hair with one hand and presented a revolver at him with the other, and the king was so grateful for not being killed that he gave the bold pirate a magnificent gold watch all covered with diamonds.
We managed to get right behind the old native without attracting his attention, and when Mike had his cross-bow about an inch from the native’s head, and all ready to fire, I touched the old man on the shoulder and smiled and stroked my face, which means in native language, “ Good-morning; I hope you and your family are quite well.” The native looked at me, and then he looked at Mike and saw the cross-bow aimed right at his head, and he dropped his fishing-rod and said in good Eng-

lish, “Don’t shoot, massa; don’t hurt a poor ole nigger; now don’t ye, don’t ye, don’t ye.”
I answered, “ We are friendly, and won’t hurt you if you are faithful to us, but you must show us where the missionary lives.”
“ Missionary ?” replied the native. “ Dere ain’t no missionary here, massa. Dere ain’t nobody but me and de family. You can go right up to de house and ax my ole woman if dere is.”
“ If you speak truly,” said I, very sternly, “ lead us to the house and give us some food. If you treat us well we will take you under our protection, but at the least sign of treachery your base life shall pay the forfeit.”
The native picked up his rod, and then he got up slowly and groaning, for he said he had the rheumatism dreadfully bad. He went up to the house, and we kept close behind him, ready to shoot if he seemed treacherous. When we came to the door he called his wife and said: “ Susan, I want you to give dese yer young gen’lemen some breakfast. They’re pretty peart boys and gimme a drefful scare when I first seen ’em; but boys will be boys.”
He seemed so friendly and so much like our own colored people that Mike and I sat down and laid our cross-bows on the floor. The native looked at them and said, “ Did you buy them bow-guns in Buffalo ?”

I said no, they came from America, which seemed to puzzle him a good deal. Then I asked him what was the name of the island, and how close it was to Africa.
“ We calls dishyer island Joneses island, but some folks calls it one name and some another. Africa’s a mighty long ways off, young gen’lemen, and you hain’t no call to make fun of an ole man.”
We couldn’t very well understand what he meant by this, but just then the native’s wife brought in some fried eggs and ham, and we had the best meal we had had since we left West Thompsonville.
After dinner I happened to notice a big map of New York on the wall, and I asked the native if he got it from the missionaries; but he said: “What fo’ you’re talkin’ about missionaries ? I never seen none. I done got that map offen a map-peddler. It’s a good map too. Here you see,” he continued, pointing to the map, “is Lake Erie, and here’s Buffalo, and right about here is dishyer island. I ’spects you come over here from Buffalo in your own boat, didn’t you ?”
I began to feel faint all over, for I knew perfectly well that Buffalo was a tremendous distance from New York. I thought, however, that perhaps there might be two Buffalos, and I asked the old man if he could point out New York on the map; and when he did so I knew that

WHEN I found out that we had made such a mistake about the direction in which we had travelled I actually cried. I know that it doesn’t seem probable that a boy of my age should cry, and I know, besides, that it was almost disgraceful, but this story wouldn’t be true if I didn’t tell the whole truth. I felt dreadfully discouraged, for I couldn’t bear the idea of travelling three or four days more in a freight-car, and New York was so far off that it would take us nearly all summer to walk there.
Mike didn’t seem to care anything about it, and all Ee said was: w Let’s go fishin’. This yer’s a first-rate place for fish.” But then Mike hadn’t a father in Europe, and it made no difference to him where he was.
The old man was real good to us. When he saw Eow bad I felt he put three more fried eggs and another big piece of ham on my plate, and told me not to mind, and that it would all come right, which was very kind; but as he didn’t know what was the matter, his opinion that it would all come right wasn’t worth very much.

I told him just how we came to run away and why we wanted to get to New York; and he said that we had better stay with him for another day, and then he would take us down to Buffalo in his boat, and get a friend of his who owned a canal-boat to take us to New York. Then he got out two more fishing-poles for Mike and me, and showed us a good place to fish, and told us that he lived mostly on fish, and that we could catch enough for dinner if we had any luck.
He was just as nice as he could be if he was black, and Mike said he reminded him of a black man who was the cook of his uncle’s ship. He was an awfully ugly man, and his teeth were all pointed and just as sharp as needles, and he was fond of little children; and whenever the ship came to a town the cook was sure to coax a little boy to come into his kitchen, and nobody ever saw the boy afterwards; but the cook would have his dinner that day all by himself with the kitchen doors and windows shut. One day Mike’s uncle had captured a big Spanish man-of-war with two thousand men on her, and as his crew was too tired to drown the men, he brought them on board his own ship and put them in the cellar and locked the cellar door, intending to drown them as soon as his men got rested. Well, in the middle of the night the prisoners made such a noise that Mike’s uncle couldn’t sleep a

wink, and he called the cook, who was the only one of the pirates who was not all worn out, and said to him, “Pomp, I want you to make those fellows keep quiet.” So Pomp opened the cellar door, and asked the prisoners to come out one at a time and have some ice-cream, and as fast as every man came out Pomp threw him overboard and drowned him. The faithful black man worked all night long, and when Mike’s uncle got up in the morning he saw the cook throw the last prisoner overboard, and drop down exhausted on the floor, saying as he did so: “Now, Massa Capen, you can sleep. Dis niggah hab quieted all dat white trash.” Mike’s uncle was so pleased with the good, kind black man that he gave him four thousand dollars on the spot and a beautiful new suit of clothes.
I asked Mike what his uncle had done with all his money, for he had barrels and barrels full of it. Mike said he had buried it. I couldn’t see why he should have done that, but Mike said that pirates always buried their money—it was one of their rules, and any pirate who didn’t do it would be hung. He said that most of his uncle’s money was buried in New Zealand, but that the rest of it was buried in a great many different places. He knew of one place where mornamillion of dollars was buried, and he knew just where to find it; but his uncle,
117

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
before telling Mike about it, made him swear never to dig it up or to let anybody know where it was. I thought this wasn’t very nice and I said so, but Mike explained that the places where pirates bury their money are always haunted by ghosts, and that if he or I should try to dig up his uncle’s money the ghosts would be perfectly sure to kill us. So Mike’s uncle was a thoughtful and considerate man, after all, which shows how wrong it is to judge a person without knowing all about him.
We caught lots of fish, and the old man put them in a box full of water, just as soon as they were caught, so that he could keep them alive, and take them to Buffalo and sell them. We had a good fish dinner, and then the old man went to sleep, while Mike and I and the oldest black boy played mumble-the-peg almost all the afternoon.
Then we went out for a sail in the old man’s boat, which was a big sail-boat, and the colored boy knew just how to manage it. Mike said it would be just the thing for a pirate ship, and he said we could have the two black boys for a crew until we captured a prize, and then there would be lots of sailors who would be glad to serve with us. Mike was always full of lovely plans, but they were always impossible, and he only worried me by proposing them, and so obliging me to say that I couldn’t do what he wanted to do.

After we had sailed up and down the front of the house we thought we would go in swimming, so we sailed close down to the other end of the island and landed on the beach where the steamboat had left us. There were two or three big boys lying on the beach, and I first thought they were alligators. I asked the colored boy if there were any alligators in the lake, and he said it was full of them, and that he had often caught a hundred of them in a day. Then I asked him if there were any whales in the lake, and he said that there used to be a great many, but that the steamboats had frightened them away, but that he had often caught small ones that weighed about two pounds. So I knew he must be telling what wasn’t true, and I said so to Mike, who told him that he was no better than a heathen to be telling stories like that, when he knew they were not true.
After our swim we ran races on the beach to dry ourselves, and something was said about the black boy’s head—I forgot to say all this time that his name was Alexander Charles Johnson—which was about the biggest head I ever saw on a boy. There were two straight trees very near the beach that stood close together, and I was leaning against them while we were talking. I told the boy that I didn’t believe he could put his head between the two trees, and he said he knew he could. So we let

him try it. He tried a long while before he could get his head through between the trees, but he got it through at last, and then the trouble began. He couldn’t pull his head out again, for every time he tried it his ears were in the way. He wasn’t frightened at first, but by the time he had worn most of the skin off his neck and made both his ears swell up he began to cry.
Mike and I couldn’t help him to get his head loose, though we both got hold of his feet and pulled our very best, and I finally told him that the only thing to do was for Mike and me to cut his ears off, and then he could get his head out without much trouble. But he said he wouldn’t have his ears cut off, and I’m sure I didn’t want to cut them, though I was awfully sorry for the boy and ready to do almost anything for him. At last he thought of the axe, and begged one of us to go to the house and bring the axe and cut one of the trees down. Now, neither Mike nor I could sail the boat, so whoever went would have to walk, and it would take him at least three hours to go and come. I offered to stay with Alexander Charles Johnson if Mike would go for the axe, and Mike said I was always doing generous things, and he hated to take advantage of me, but still he would go.	•
It was very tiresome waiting for Mike and the axe, and it was dark long before he got back. The colored boy 120

was, I suppose, a little tired, for he cried every now and then, and was pretty cross; so I left him and went a little farther down the beach, till he promised that he would be reasonable if I would come back and stay. I wasn’t quite sure that there might not be alligators in the water, and they are very dangerous unless you know just what to do with them. The way they eat is to put their food behind them and then to sweep it into their mouths with their tails. There was once a man who was walking along a beach with his wife and his aunt when they were attacked by a monstrous alligator. The women did not know any better than to run behind the alligator, so he swept them right into his mouth with one blow of his tail, and swallowed them as quick as anything. Then the man said: “ Oh, that is your game, is it ? We’ll see, Mr. Alligator, if we can’t get a little ahead of you,” so he ran up and sat down directly on the alligator’s nose. The animal was dreadfully surprised and angry, but he couldn’t possibly hit the man with his tail. So the man sat -on the alligator’s nose, and read a newspaper and whistled as comfortably as you please, till a man with a gun came along and shot the animal.
I tried to comfort Alexander Charles by telling him that Mike would bring the axe before morning, and that we could cut the tree down as soon as it was daylight, and
121
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe that we could probably do it, by taking turns, in the course of the day, for it wasn’t a very big tree; but he wouldn’t be cheered up. He said he was almost starved to death and was sure he would die anyway, and he made me feel quite uncomfortable; for when two boys are alone in the woods at night each one ought to be cheerful and to try to make the other cheerful, instead of talking about starving to death and other unpleasant things.
After a long while Mike came back with the axe and the old man and a lantern. The old man scolded the boy a little for his foolishness, and then went to work to cut the tree down, but almost the first thing he did was to hit the lantern with the axe and knock it all to pieces. He tried to chop a little in the dark, but he nearly cut his own leg off, and Alexander Charles was so frightened that he made him give up chopping down the tree.
It looked as if the boy would have to stay where he was till daylight, when I suddenly thought of a plan to get him loose without cutting down a tree. I told the old man that we could get a rope out of the sail-boat and tie one end to one of the trees, and pull on the rope till we bent the tree enough to let the boy get his head out. The old man said he didn’t believe it would work, but we could try it. He was very much pleased, and so, too, was Alexander Charles, when we succeeded in bending the 122

tree and letting the boy loose, and he said I was a very smart boy, and would be President of the United States some day.
Then we all got into the boat and sailed back to the house, where we had some supper, and the old man let us sleep on some hay on the floor.
I could have stayed on that island for a year, and, of course, the old man would have been glad to have had us stay, but I couldn’t afford to waste time; for while I was fishing and sailing and enjoying myself on Jones’s island, Europe might take fire and burn up like Chicago, and father would have to go somewhere else, and when I did get to Europe I could not find him. I told Mike that night that, lovely as the island was, we must leave it as soon as possible and start once more on our way to Europe. To my surprise he said he thought so too, and the sooner we got away from the island the better. I couldn’t quite understand this, until he told me that he had just found out something about Europe that made him very anxious to go there. He had seen an old newspaper in the sail-boat which said in big letters that Europe was on the Brink of a Volcano, and that a Tremendous Explosion was At Hand. Mike said that of all things in the world he wanted to see a volcano, and, besides, if Europe was in danger of be-123

This news alarmed me a good deal I didn’t care much what became of Europe if father wasn’t there, but it would be dreadful to have your father blown up by a volcano. I wondered how father had ever ventured to go and live in such a place, but I suppose nobody knew that it was on a volcano at the time he went there. What the newspaper said must be true, for it was in print; and I would have given anything if I had been sure that father knew all about it, and was taking proper precautions to protect himself from the explosion.

THE old man called us early the next day to go fishing with him, for he wanted to have fish enough to take to Buffalo to sell. Mike and I fished from daylight up to seven o’clock, and then, as soon as breakfast was over, we put the fish and a lot of vegetables into the sail-boat, and we all started for Buffalo. Alexander Charles and the other little boy, whose name was Napoleon Washington Lincoln Johnson, came with us.
The boys thought our cross-bows were magnificent, and as the old man had been so kind to us we told the boys they might have them.
They were perfectly delighted, and wanted to shoot at a mark Tight away. I told Alexander Charles about William Tell, who shot an apple from his son’s head because a man named Gesler had dared him to do it, and when he had hit the apple he offered to bet that he could shoot another from Gesler’s head; but Gesler said, “ Oh no, he didn’t bet about apples, but he was ready to bet that he would have Tell arrested in about three

minutes ”; but Tell ran away before Gesler could call a policeman. And by this means he delivered his country from something, though I don’t exactly remember what it was.
After this nothing would satisfy Alexander Charles except to shoot an apple from Napoleon Washington Lincoln’s head, but I told him that he ought not to do it, because it was dangerous, and thSt there wasn’t an apple in the boat, though there were some turnips, and one of them would do just about as well as an apple. But he wouldn’t listen to reason and insisted upon standing his brother up against the mast with a turnip on his head. The old man, who was steering the boat, was half asleep and didn’t notice anything until Napoleon Washington Lincoln gave a dreadful scream and began kicking just like those little wooden figures that children play with and that kick their arms and legs whenever you pull a string.
Of course Alexander Charles had missed the turnip and had hit his brother. The arrow had gone right through one of the boy’s ears and nailed it to the mast. I once read some verses about a captain of a frigate who “nailed his colors to the mast,” but I never knew what it meant till I saw our smallest colored boy nailed to the mast.

I tried to pull the arrow out, but I only pulled the wooden part of the arrow away from the sharp nail that was on the end of it, and which stayed in the boy’s ear. The old man had to wake up and hunt all over for a hammer to pull the nail out with, and then Napoleon sat down and held his ear and howled nearly all the rest of the way to Buffalo. Alexander Charles got a good scolding, and it served him right, for nobody has a right to risk putting out a boy’s eyes by shooting things from his head.
I felt in pretty good spirits when we got to Buffalo, for I had made up my mind that all we had to do was to persevere and we would get to Europe at last. Perseverance will accomplish everything. I had these words for a writing lesson once, and I shall never forget them. It is a great thing to have perseverance. There was once a man who was shut up in a dungeon with walls two hundred feet thick, made of the hardest kind of stone. He had no tools except a pair of scissors that his brother had sent him in a loaf of bread, but he remembered that a drop of water will wear away a stone if it falls on the stone long enough, and that the coral worm, which is so small that you can hardly see it, will eat up and destroy a great big coral reef if you only give it time enough. So he said that he would persevere and dig a bole through 127

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe the wall of the dungeon with the scissors and escape, if it took him a hundred years.
He had been digging about a year when the governor pardoned him, and the jailer brought him the joyful news. But they couldn’t get him to leave the dungeon. He told the jailer that he had undertaken to dig his way through the wall, and escape in that way, and that he was going to stick to it, no matter how long it might take. The jailer urged him to give it up and walk out of the door, and even offered him ten dollars to give up his dungeon to a new lodger, but nothing could induce him to change his mind. So he stayed in the dungeon and dug away at the wall for forty-seven years, and every six months he had to pay a big bill for damages to the jail, and he finally died when he was nearly half through the wall. This shows what a splendid thing perseverance is, and that we all ought to persevere.
Buffalo was built just where the Erie Canal empties into Lake Erie, and it is full of canal-boats. After the old man had sold his fish and vegetables, he took us to a canal-boat and introduced us to Captain Montgomery, who was a young colored man. The old man told him that we wanted to get to New York and hadn’t any money, but that we were good boys and were anxious to travel on his boat and work for him. Captain Mont-

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe gomery talked about it for a while and said that times were hard and that he didn’t need any one to help him, but he finally said he’d take us to accommodate his old and steamed friend Mr. Johnson, though Mr. Johnson looked more as if he had been dried up than steamed.
We were sorry to say good-bye to the old man. He had been just as good to us as he could be, and even Mike said that he would never say a word against a colored man again. I told the old man that when I saw father I’d ask him for some money to send to him to pay him for what he had done, but he said he wouldn’t take it, and all he wanted was to see me and Mike safely away from his island and know that we were going so far away that we could never get back again. I never saw a nicer old man.
A canal-boat is a great long box that floats on the water. There is a man on the roof who steers, and a woman who hangs out clothes, and a dog who barks; but as a general thing somebody steals the dog, so you very seldom see him on the right boat. Then there are two mules who are harnessed to the boat and walk along the shore and drag it and pay no attention to the boy who drives them.
The captain told Mike to help the boy drive the mules, and he had me stay on the boat and help him with 129

the ropes; for whenever we went through a lock we had to tie one end of the boat fast to a big post on the shore. A lock isn’t anything like a lock, but it is only a square hole filled with water and having a pair of gates at each end. The canal-boat goes into the lock through one pair t of gates and then they are shut and locked, and then some of the water is let out of the lock and the boat gradually sinks down till it is on a level with the water in the part of the canal which is outside of the other gates, and then the other gates are opened and the boat goes on. This has to be done whenever the canal goes down hill, because if it wasn’t done and there were no locks the current would be too strong.
I don’t say that a lock isn’t an ingenious invention, but if the canal men only knew as much as Mike’s uncle they need not have any locks. Mike told me that once his uncle, being chased by a fleet of fifty men-of-war, came to the coast of China. He had about six hours’ start of the fleet, and he employed this time in making two axle-trees and four big wheels, and put them under his ship, and then he sailed away from the land about a mile, so as to get a good headway, and then steered straight for the beach. By this time the fleet was close behind him, but what was the astonishment of his enemies to see his ship run right up the beach and sail

off into the country as fast as a railroad train. They had chased the pirate ship so fast that when she ran up the beach they couldn’t stop, and as their ships had no wheels they were all wrecked and everybody was drowned. Mike’s uncle sailed across the land for about five miles and then he came to a river, where he took off his wheels, launched his ship, and sailed down to the ocean again. If the canal-boatmen would only put wheels on their boats they wouldn’t need any locks, but whenever they came to a hill they could be dragged down or up it like a wagon, and then be launched in the canal again.
We lived on the canal-boat all that day and night, and there an accident happened. I was helping the woman hang out clothes, when Captain Montgomery dropped his pipe and began to yell at Mike and the other boy as loud as he could. I looked to see what was the matter, and there were the two boys fighting on the tow-path, and the mules had stopped just as politely as possible to wait till the fight was over, and, of course, our boat was stopping too. Now there was another boat just behind us, and it was sure to run into us if we didn’t get out of the way, so it was no wonder Captain Montgomery was frightened. Seeing that it didn’t do any good to yell to the boys, he told the woman to steer, and jumped ashore
181

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
and started up the mules himself just in time to prevent the boat that was behind us from striking us. As soon as the mules were started, the captain ran back and threw both Mike and the other boy into the canal, and as soon as they had scrambled out he made the other boy attend to the mules while he laid the boy’s whip over Mike for a few minutes. Then he came on the boat again, and drove me off, and shouted to Mike and me that if we came near the boat again he’d drown us. The woman was good enough to get our bundles and throw them to us, and that was the last we saw of Captain Montgomery and his boat.
I told Mike he had done very wrong to fight and to neglect the mules, but he said the boy had told him that he was a liar, and that his uncle Patrick was only a tramp, and Mike wouldn’t stand it. However, we had already travelled a good ways towards New York, and we thought that it was very likely that we could get some other captains to take us.
So we walked on slowly, so as not to overtake Captain Montgomery, and when we came to the next lock we waited there, and asked every captain that came along if he would let us go with him. They all said no, and some of them said worse things, until, finally, one man said that he would take us. He was a white man, and an 132

Irishman, and though I never knew his name, his boat was named the Water Lily.
We did not have much to do on the Water Lily. The captain let us help the woman hang out the clothes, and then she let us wash the dishes and scour the knives. After that we swept the roof of the boat, and then played jack-stones till it was time to go to sleep.
We did not tell the captain where we were going. That is, I didn’t, for when he asked us how far we wanted to go, Mike said that we wanted to go all the way with him, and he said all right. I remembered this afterwards, because it was one reason why we made another mistake about getting to New York. We ought to have told him that we were going to New York, but I didn’t happen to think of it at the right time.
It was about five o’clock in the afternoon of the next day that we arrived at a big city, which I supposed was New York; but, in order to be sure, I asked a man who stood on the shore of the canal if it was New York, and he said, “ Oh, yes, this is New York.” So we said goodbye to the captain, and the woman who was hanging out the clothes, and went ashore.
There was a large steamboat lying at a wharf all ready to start, and Mike and I walked straight on board of her. Now that we had really got to New York, I thought we 133

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
need not save our dollar any longer. I was so tired of hiding away on boats and railroad trains that I told Mike I wouldn’t do it any more, and that we would go boldly on board the steamboat, and that after she had started we would go to the captain and give him the dollar, and tell him that if it was not enough to pay our passage to Europe we would work for him. Mike said that anything would suit him, but that he thought I had better offer the captain fifty cents instead of a dollar, for, in case the regular fare was only twenty-five cents apiece, we should not be wasting all our money.
After we had sailed so far that we could not see New York, I and Mike went up to the captain, and I told him that we wanted to go to Europe to meet my father, and had a dollar to pay our fare with, and that if that wasn’t enough we would work for him. I said I should have come straight to him before the boat left New York, only I was afraid he might not be willing to let us come.
“What on earth do you mean by New York?” asked the captain, looking very much puzzled.
“ Isn’t that place that the boat started from New York, sir?” I asked.
“ New York!” replied the captain. “ Why, boy, you must be crazy. That’s Oswego.”
“And isn’t this the Atlantic Ocean?” I asked, begin-184

“ This is Lake Ontario, and this boat goes to Montreal, and you’re going to the idiot asylum, I expect,” answered the captain, with a real cruel laugh.

T was dreadfully discouraging to find that we had made another mistake, but it was partly due to the wicked man at Oswego who had told me it was New York, when he knew very well that it wasn’t. Besides, Oswego is a very improbable place, anyway. There is no sense in saying Oswego, or Osyougo, or Ostheygo, and nobody could be expected to know that there was really such a place as Oswego, and to take care not to get there.
Still, whether it was our fault or not, we had gone to Oswego instead of New York, and now we were going to Montreal instead of Europe. I had read about Montreal in my geography, and I remembered that it was ever so far away from New York, and I wondered how we would ever manage to travel all the way from Montreal to New York without any money.
But the captain of the steamboat treated us very nicely. He wouldn’t take my dollar, and he told me that I could go to Europe from Montreal just as well as from New York. He said that if I had any sense he wpuld get 136
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe somebody to send me home, but that he thought it wouldn’t be treating my friends kindly to send me back, now that I had left them, and that he did not want to do anything cruel.
Then he told us how to find the steamboat that went from Montreal to Europe. She was named the Sarmatian, and if we got on board of her there couldn’t be any mistake about our getting to Europe. I asked the captain if the Sarmatian stopped at Africa and China on her way to Europe, but he said no, and that she never stopped anywhere on the way, except now and then, at a place called Switzerland, where ships sometimes stopped for ice. He said that tjiere would be no use in asking the captain of the Sarmatian to take us, for he wouldn’t do it even for two dollars, and that we would have to hide ourselves on the steamboat for two days, and then the captain wouldn’t be able to put us ashore.
The captain of the Oswego steamboat was the kindest man we had met, except the old colored man. He not only took us to Montreal for nothing and gave us lots of good advice, but he gave us all we wanted to eat, and we were really sorry when we got to Montreal.
The first thing we did after getting to Montreal was to find the Sarmatian. The steamboat captain told us where to look for her, and when we found her lying at 137
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe the wharf we were disappointed to find how ugly and dirty she looked. I asked a man, and afterwards a boy, whom we met on the wharf, if the boat was really the Sarmatian, and they both said she was, and the boy said that the Governor of Montreal was going to Europe in her, which was the reason she had been made to look so nice. If that was what the Montreal people think is a nice-looking steamer, I wonder what they would think an ugly one.
After looking at the Sarmatian and finding that she was going to sail early the next morning, Mike and I laid in our provisions for the journey across the Atlantic, for from what the captain of the Oswego boat said, I knew that we must have provisions for two days. We bought a pie, and some cheese, and pea-nuts, and candy, and got an empty bottle and filled it with water. Then I remembered that I hadn’t written to father for some time, so I bought a sheet of paper, and an envelope, and a pencil, and wrote something like this:
“Montreal, Aug. 10.
“Dear Father,—We are now at Montreal, and are getting along first rate. We arrived here to-day on our way from West Thompsonville to New York, but we are not going to New York any more, for we shall sail for 138

Europe to-morrow morning. We are quite well and hope you are the same. Mike sends his love, and I know you will be glad to see him, for his uncle is a most distinguished man. As it is getting late I must close.
“Your affectionate Son,
“ James Brown.”
I directed this letter to the Grand Hotel, and felt sure that when father got it he would not feel anxious, about me.
Just as it was getting dark we found a good chance to get on board the Sarmatian, and to hide ourselves in the cellar on the top of a great lot of barrels. There was just room enough between the ceiling and the barrels for us to lie down, but as the barrels were standing on their ends, instead of lying on their sides, we had the flat barrel-heads to lie on, and though the rims cut into our legs a little, it wasn’t so very uncomfortable, after all.
We didn’t sleep very much that night, for there were mornamillion rats in that steamboat, and they were determined to steal our cheese. One of us had to stay awake all the time, and hit the rats with the water-bottle whenever they ran over the other fellow. When Mike struck at the rats he generally missed them, but he never missed me; and it’s very hard work to sleep when some-
139
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe body is constantly hammering you with a heavy bottle. Then it was awfully hot down where we were, although the cellar door was open all the time.
I don’t like rats at all, although, when a man is shut up in prison for life, he generally has a rat who comes to see him, and is as intelligent and friendly as anything. There was once a prisoner who was so lonesome that he wished he was dead, but one day the jailer put a rattrap in his cell, and a rat came in, and the man fed him with bits of cheese and cake and pudding, till the rat got so tame that he used to sleep with the man and never thought of biting him or squeaking. This rat was so intelligent that he could do sums beautifully by dipping his tail in the inkstand and writing down the figures on a piece of paper; and he was so affectionate that when the man had a headache he would sit by his pillow and cry till the tears ran down his cheeks. The prisoner and the rat lived very happily together, and the rat kept the prisoner’s accounts, and did no end of things. But one day the servant, when she was sweeping out the' dungeon, accidentally stepped on the trap and broke it, and the next time the rat came in and saw that the trap was gone he turned pale and ran into his hole. In vain did the prisoner beg the jailer to put another trap into the dungeon, so that the rat would feel safe and would come back 140
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe again, but the jailer refused, and the rat was never seen again, and the prisoner died when he was eighty-seven years old of a broken heart. This teaches us that we should avoid being prisoners, and should treat animals with kindness.
The steamboat started sometime in the morning, and all that day it went along without rolling in the least. But sometime in the morning it began to roll and pitch and do all sorts of things, and Mike and I became sea-sick. We gave the cheese to the rats to get rid of them, but the greedy pigs fought over it, and when it was gone wanted more and behaved worse than ever. We were too sick to hammer them with the bottle, and the only thing we could do was to kick when they tried to bite our shoes.
I suppose it must have been early the next morning when a man came into the cellar with a lantern. Just at that minute Mike happened to get his fingers in between two barrels, and the boat rolled, and the barrels sagged a little and gave him an awful squeeze, so that he yelled as loud as he could. The man was frightened nearly to death. He said something which I could not understand, and dropped his lantern and ran.
Now when he dropped his lantern it broke, and the oil caught fire and began to blaze. I saw it was sure to catch some pine boxes that were close to it, and that the
141
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe ship would then burn up and everybody would be burned or drowned. So I called out “ fire ” as loud as I could, and jumped up and put my blanket on the fire, and put it out by the time that three more men with buckets of water came rushing into the cellar.
I had read, when I was young, that the best way to put out a fire was to wrap blankets around it, and Mike told me the next day that his uncle once saved his ship with blankets. She had caught fire from one of the gas-lights that leaked, and the carpenter called Mike’s uncle and said, “ Please, sir, the ship’s all on fire,” and Mike’s uncle said, just as cool as a cucumber, “Bring one thousand blankets here, and twenty-five sail-makers with their sewing-machines, instantly.” As soon as his order was obeyed, he had all the blankets sewed together and then wrapped around the ship and tied with stout twine. This put the fire out and saved the ship, though not until most all the partitions were burned, and the plastering and paper all scorched.
The men were natdrally glad to find the fire all put out, but they caught hold of me, and all chattered at once in some language of which I could not understand a word. Mike had been too sick to help me put out the fire, but when he saw that I was a prisoner he climbed down from the barrels and surrendered. The men took us up on the
142
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe roof and showed us to the captain, and he and all three of them kept on talking the most ridiculous language I ever heard in my life.
They asked us a lot of questions, but as we could not understand them we made signs that we were friendly and wanted something to eat, just as if they were savages. This did not satisfy them, and the captain sent for another man who could talk a little, and I told him who we were, and how we came on the Sarmatian, and how I put the fire out. Then he talked awhile with the captain, and the end of it was that the captain patted me on the shoulder, and sent Mike and me away with the man who could talk, and who gave us some breakfast, though Mike was too sick to eat anything.
This man, who was the steward, was very nice, and I found out from him that we were not on the Sarmatian at all, but on a little steamboat named the Sanjon, that wasn’t going to Europe, but only to France. The reason why the men on the steamboat could not talk was that they were Frenchmen, and Frenchmen are all born in such a way that, instead of talking so that other people can understand them, they can only talk what is called French.
I can explain our mistaking this little steamboat for the Sarmatian only by supposing that we mistook the
143

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
directions that the Oswego captain gave us when he told us how to find the Sarmatian. Of course the man and the boy whom we met on the wharf told us stories when they said that the little steamboat was the Sarmatian, but since we started from West Thompsonville we had met a good many people who seemed to think it was a nice thing to tell us stories. I can’t see anything smart in telling lies, and Mike said the same thing too.
It was a terrible thing to find that instead of going to Europe we were going to France; but I made up my mind that there must be some way of getting from France to Europe, and that we would stick to it till we got there. I tried to tell Mike about it, but he was lying on the floor, and when I spoke to him all he would say was, “ Lemme alone; lemme die, won’t you ?” You see Mike was very sea-sick, but I had got all over being sea-sick after the steward had given me some breakfast I do pity a person who is sea-sick, though, as I told Mike, if he would only get up and eat some fried eggs and take an interest in things he would feel better.
The steward said that the captain was very angry when he first heard that we were on the ship, but when he found out that I had put out the fire he changed his mind, and said that we should have some breakfast, and that when we felt better we should work our passage.
144

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
This would have been just what we wanted if the steamboat had only been going to Europe, and at any rate it was a great deal better than it would have been if the captain had been very angry and had put us ashore in Africa.
I found out another thing, that instead of being only two or three days on the ocean, we should have to sail fourteen days before we could get to France. I didn’t mind this very much, but Mike did, and when I told him about it he said he wished he had died before he had been fool enough to come with me. Of course I felt offended at this, but after Mike got over being sea-sick he said he was sorry, and we were good friends again.
After a day or two Mike felt better, and the steward told us we were to go to work. We had only enough work to do to keep us from getting tired, and we really began to enjoy ourselves. Everybody treated us well, although it was a little aggravating to have them come and chatter to us in French, instead of talking like rational human beings. The weather was pleasant, and we had plenty to eat, and Mike said that he had made up his mind to be a sailor, and should look out for a situation on a pirate ship as soon as we had found father.

DON’T think very much of the ocean. For one thing it is a great deal too large. It must be mornahundred miles wide, and it is over your head almost everywhere. I tried to touch bottom half a dozen times with a pole that was over ten feet long, and couldn’t. There was a big pond in West Thompsonville, and the man it belonged to dug a ditch and drained it, so that it turned into a little narrow brook. Somebody ought to drain the ocean, and then people could go to Europe on the railroad cars, and nobody would be sea-sick.
I used to think the ocean was full of whales and seaserpents and other interesting and improving animals, but it isn’t true. I didn’t see a single one, and about the only thing I saw was porpoises, and I don’t think much of them, for they keep jumping out of the water all the time instead of swimming along in a quiet, respectable way.
Mike said that a sea-serpent once attacked his uncle’s ship. The sea-serpent was almost a mile long, and as
140
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
big around as a hogshead. It wound itself three or four times round the ship, and then squeezed it so that it was mashed all out of shape and every piece of wood and iron in it was broken. Mike’s uncle and twelve men managed to launch a boat and escape in time, but all the rest of the crew were killed. After the sea-serpent had crushed the ship he unwound himself, and licked the ship all over and swallowed it, and then stretched himself out on the top of the water and went to sleep. But the copper that was on the bottom of the ship was poisonous, though the sea-serpent didn’t know it; and after a little while he began to twist himself up as if he had a dreadful pain in his stomach, and died. Then Mike’s uncle, who had a saw and an axe in the boat, cut the sea-serpent up into lengths of thirty feet, and tied them together with ropes and made a raft, and lived on it for ten days till they were picked up by another ship.
I should like very much' to see a sea-serpent, but I suppose by this time the ocean has been pretty well fished out, and mostly all the sea-serpents have been killed. My writing-book used to say, “Travel improves the Mind,” but I don’t see how you can improve your mind very much on the ocean.	.
There was once a man who was blind, but he could do the most wonderful sums, and he kept doing them all the
147
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
time. If you told him that a boy gave one hundred and thirty-eight apples to seven thousand and eighteen pigs, and then killed the pigs and had them cut up and sold, the man could tell you almost as quick as a wink how much apple there would be in every quarter of a ham.
Well, this man became very trying to his friends after a while, and no wonder, and the doctor said, “ You must travel and improve your mind.” So he was put on a ship that sailed clear around the world, and only stopped for a little while at a few continents and islands to take in wood and water. The man was dreadfully sea-sick all the time, and never once got out of his bed till the ship got home again; and when they carried him up to his house he was so weak that he couldn’t do a single sum. So the doctor came and looked at his tongue and said that his mind had been wonderfully improved by foreign travel, and the man died that night, and a beautiful funeral sermon was preached about him. But I don’t believe his mind was improved very much, after all.
There were no passengers on the steamboat except Mike and me, and I suppose she was like a freight-train on a railroad that carries nothing but barrels and boxes and tramps, and runs a good deal slower than other trains. It took us sixteen days to get to France, and I was very glad when we saw the land once more.

A painful accident happened that day. We were about half a mile from the land, and Mike and I were at the front end of the ship looking at the land, and all the crew were having their dinner. A great big anchor had been hung over the side of the ship, ready to be used, and I was looking to see how it was fastened, when I saw a little iron pin about .the size of a nail that was pushed part way through a little staple. I thought I would push it all the way through, but as it seemed to stick a little I pulled it out to see what was the matter. That very instant the anchor dropped of its own accord, and the chain it was fastened to ran out with the most awful noise, and the ship stopped with a jerk that very nearly upset the captain and the man who was steering.
All the sailors and everybody on the ship ran up on the roof and began to yell and chatter as if they had all gone crazy; and about a dozen men rushed to a little boat and were going to cut it loose, only the captain hit two of them on the head with a club and persuaded them to keep quiet. When they found out that nothing was the matter except that the ship was accidentally anchored, the men got over their fright and set to work to get the anchor up again. This took them an hour, and all that time the captain kept walking up and down, and chatter-
149
Digitized by GOOQle
Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe ing to himself and scolding me every time he came near me, and behaving in what I call a disgraceful way. For I can’t see what I had to do with the accident, for you can’t tell me that a great big anchor was fastened with a little pin, and that the anchor dropped because I happened to pull the pin out. However, the captain did conduct himself in a way that was very painful to his friends, and if he had known how to talk I should have told him that he really must restrain his feelings or else go off by himself until he felt better.
About four o’clock we came to a little narrow river, and after going a very short distance up it we came to a big stone wharf, and the steward told me that we had got to France. It seemed to me to be a large city, but the streets were narrow, and I couldn’t see any building that was as handsome as Mr. Travers’s house. There were six or seven different kinds of soldiers on the wharf, and it was a long while before they would let anybody go ashore. Just before sunset the steward told us we could go and say good-bye to the captain, and then go ashore. So I went up to the captain and thanked him, and put out my hand to shake hands, but he didn’t shake hands, which was very rude, and only laughed, and patted me on the shoulder. Then he gave me a queer little piece of money, something like a quarter of a dollar, only smaller, 150

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe
and, I suppose, a lot of good advice, though, of course, I couldn’t understand it.-
As soon as Mike and I got ashore we were stopped by two soldiers, who wore funny three-cornered hats, and who, I suppose, asked us questions, and thought we were deaf, for, when we didn’t answer, they kept on louder and louder. However, they got tired after a while, and let us go.
We walked through the streets, looking at the city and improving our minds until dark, and then we began to wonder where we could sleep. As I had nearly sixty cents left, besides the money that the French captain had given me, I said we would go to a hotel; but we went to three, and the people couldn’t understand what we wanted, and must have thought that we were asking the way to some place, for they took us to the door apd pointed down the street, and then gave us a shove.
Mike wasn’t a very bright boy, but sometimes he had a good idea. While we were trying to get a hotel-keeper to understand us, Mike said, “Let’s go and find an American steamboat where there is somebody who can talk,” and I wondered I had not thought of that before. So we went straight down to the river. There were a good many steamboats there, but the soldiers would not let us go on board of any one of them. Then I told Mike

that we would just stand still and ask every man who passed us if he could talk, and very likely we should find some one who could.
There is nothing more unpleasant than a whole city where nobody can talk. What people can be thinking of that they don’t send missionaries to France and teach the people to talk like other folks, I can’t imagine. It could be done, for the steward on the French steamboat was a Frenchman, and he could talk very nicely—much better, indeed, than any parrot I ever heard.
Mike and I must have asked mornahundred men if they could talk, and not one of them understood us until, finally, a big man with a large red beard said, “ Well, I dessay I can talk a bit, but what of it?” Then I told him that we had sixty cents, and wanted a place to sleep, but that the hotel-keepers couldn’t understand us; and he said, “ Well, come along to my hotel, and we’ll see what we can do.”
He was a very pleasant man, and he said he was an Englishman. I told him who we were, and that we were on our way to Europe, and asked him what was the best way to get there from France. Then he told us that Europe wasn’t a city, but it was a tremendous big Continent, with mornahundred cities in it, and that France was in Europe, just as New York is in America. He said 152

I might as well look for a needle in a hay-stack as to look for the Grand Hotel, for there was a Grand Hotel in nearly every city in Europe.
This was the worst news I had ever heard, and I began to give up all hope of finding father. Mike saw how bad I felt, and he made believe to think nothing of it. “ We’ll foind the ould jintleman aisy enough,” said he. u Can’t we go to iviry blessed city in Europe and ask afther the Grand Hotel ? Sure we’ll foind him if we does that, Jimmy, and I’ll go wid ye, niver you fear.” But I knew that this would take too long, and that if we ever did find father in that way we would find that he had gone back to America. I
I told Mike that I was afraid we would have to go back to West Thompsonville, if we could get there; but he said that was all nonsense, and wanted to know if I had forgotten all I had said about perseverance. At the same time he said that he had always thought that we had made a great mistake in not staying on the island in Lake Erie and being pirates when we had a nice boat all ready for us and a crew of two colored boys, and that a fellow didn’t have a chance like that more than once, and that we would never have such a chance again.
Then he tried to cheer me up by telling me a story about his uncle, but I am sorry to say he made it up and

it wasn’t true. I am not going to tell what it was, but I will only say that it was improbable, and that I could not believe that it had ever happened. Mike had frequently told what wasn’t true to other people, but this was the first time I had ever known him to tell me anything that was too improbable to be believed, and I didn’t like it a bit and told him so, but he didn’t get angry as he generally did when any one doubted his word.
The Englishman arranged that we were to sleep at his hotel that night. He told us that it wouldn’t do for us to be all alone without any money in France, for either we would starve to death or else the police would put us in prison. He said that he thought it was very likely that father was in a city called Paris that was not a great way from where we then were, and that he was willing to lend ns money to pay our fare on the railroad to Paris. When we got to Paris we could go to the Grand Hotel and see if father was there, and if he wasn’t we could go to a man who was called a Consul and was sent to Paris by the President with directions to do everything any American could possibly want, and to lend them money and give them food and clothes and tickets for the circus. I was delighted to hear that there was such a good man in Paris, and Mike and I agreed that if we couldn’t find father there we would go and live with the Consul for a few

weeks, and then have him pay our fare back to West Thompsonville and give us some nice presents to take to our friends.
So, after all, we went to bed in good spirits, and I felt pretty sure that I would find father in Paris the next day and all our troubles would be over; and even if we didn’t find him, there was the Consul to take care of us, which would be almost as good.

WE were called early the next morning, and when we got up we found breakfast ready for us, and the kind Englishman waiting to go to the train with us. He paid the bill, and told me to keep my money till we should get to Paris, and then he went to the station with us and bought our tickets and put us in the cars, and gave us a card with his name on it and an account of what he had paid for us.
We had a beautiful ride to Paris. It took nearly all day, and the country was very pretty, considering that it was France. I can’t say much for the French railroad cars. They are just big wooden boxes with wooden seats that go straight across the cars, and they have doors at the sides instead of the ends. I expected to buy some pea-nuts from the boy, but I didn’t see any boy, and I am sorry to say that there are no pea-nuts in France. This is a great pity, for, as I found out afterwards, they have very good circuses in France, but what good is a circus if you can’t buy any pea-nuts ?

There was a little step that runs all along the outside of the cars. I suppose it was put there so that people could walk from one car to another if they wanted to. There was no ice-water in our car, so Mike and I thought we would enter into another car and look for some. I -never supposed that there could he any harm in it, for I thought that even if the passengers did not use the step, the conductor and the newsboy would keep walking along it all the time, so as to slam the doors.
We opened a door on each side of the car, and Mike got out of one door and I out of the other, and we started to walk along the train. You never could imagine how excited everybody got. The passengers all put their heads out of the windows and screamed at the top of their voices. One man caught hold of Mike and pulled him into a car window and tore almost all his clothes off, and the engine whistled and the train stopped. Then a man in some kind of a uniform came running up and caught me by the collar. The passengers got out and came and stood around me, and everybody talked—as I suppose they call it—in French, and I began to think they were going to kill me. Then another man in uniform dragged Mike up to where I was, and there was more noise, and Mike was frightened half to death. The end of it was that Mike and I were handcuffed together, m

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe and put into a car where there was nobody except one soldier with a three-cornered hat and a big sword, who watched us, and shook his finger at us every little while.
I never saw such a tremendous fuss made about such a little thing, but I suppose that Frenchmen, not being able to talk to one another in a way that they can easily understand, are apt to get frightened when anything unusual happens. The soldier who was with us seemed to think that we were very dangerous, and he hardly ever took his eyes off of us, and whenever the train stopped a crowd of people came and looked in the windows at us.
We went through two tunnels, and as there was no light in the car it was pitch-dark in the tunnels. I had tried, while going through one tunnel, to see if I could not slip my wrist out of the handcuff, and I found that I could. So I told Mike that the next tunnel we came to I would slip out my wrist and open the door, and that the minute we got out of the tunnel we would jump off the train. You see the train was running quite slow, and I had often practised jumping on to trains at home just when they started from the station, and jumping off again before they got out of the town. Mike said he would jump off any train that I would jump off, and just then we came to a tunnel. It was not a very long one, but I had time to get my wrist loose and the door 158

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe open, and the moment we got out of the tunnel we jumped.
The train was running close along the side of the river, and we jumped directly into the water. We scrambled out and ran across the country as fast as we could. I don’t know whether they stopped the train or not, for it went around a curve and we could not see it, but we never heard any more of the soldier who was guarding us. We left our bundles with him, and perhaps he preferred to keep them and say nothing about it, instead of hunting us up.
It so happened that we were only a little way from Paris when we jumped, for we walked up a little hill, and there, only two or three miles off, we saw a tremendously big city, which we supposed must be Paris. This time we did not make any mistake, for it was Paris, and we saw that we could easily get there before night.
Mike was in good spirits because we had escaped from the train, but he was disgusted with the handcuff which was fastened to his right wrist. So I told him I would get it off for him. I made him hold his wrist on the top of a flat stone, and then I found another big stone, as heavy as I could lift with both hands, and I held it up as high as my head and let it drop on the handcuff. It broke the handcuff, so that Mike got his hand loose

without any trouble, but I am sorry to say that he was very angry because the stone smashed his hand a good deal and made it bleed. Only one of his fingers was broken, however, and after I had tied his hand up for him and it had stopped hurting as badly as it did at first, he became cheerful again and began to tell me a story about his uncle; but I stopped him and wouldn’t let him tell it, because I had lost confidence in his stories since he told me one that was improbable. I was sorry for him, but it couldn’t be helped, and I told him that I hoped it would be a warning to him to stick to the truth.
When we reached Paris we found that it had an enormous big stone wall all around it, and Mike said that it would not do for us to go in at the front gate, for the soldiers would be sure to be watching for us. So we turned down another road and walked a long distance till we came to what I suppose was the back gate. There were a good many soldiers there, but they only looked at us pretty sharply and did not try to stop us.
There were some omnibuses inside the gate, and we thought we would ride in one of them, but they wouldn’t let us get inside or even on the top. It must have been because we were so ragged. Besides, Mike’s hand was gll tied up, and his clothes, what there was left of then}, ISO

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe which was mostly rags, were bloody. So we had to walk. Of course we did not know the way to the Grand Hotel, but every few minutes I stopped somebody and said “Grand Hotel.” Generally they didn’t say anything that we could understand, but every now and then somebody would point down one street and up another, which we supposed meant the way to the hotel.
We saw lots of things in the windows that we wanted, and that we determined to remember and ask the Consul to buy for us. Paris is a very nice city in most respects, and it is the greatest pity in the world that the people cannot talk. It is inhabited by a great many cats; but I am sorry to say that most of the dogs are Spitz dogs, and I must say I don’t like a Spitz. I suppose that the day we got to Paris it was a sort of Fourth of July, and there had been a procession, for the streets were full of soldiers going home, and without their guns, which they had left at their armory.
Paris is very crowded, and there are hundreds of people who can’t get into the houses to eat their supper, and have to sit out at little tables on the sidewalks. I don’t know what they do when they want to go to sleep at night, for the bedrooms must be all full; but perhaps they do like the sailors at sea, and half of them sleep while the other half sit up. I think this must be the way it is

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europt done, for whenever I went to bed, no matter how late it was, the streets were full of people.
Paris is governed differently from New York. Some* times there is a president, like ours, and sometimes there is a king and sometimes an emperor. An emperor is like a king, only more so. Instead of having a regular election day, the people every few years get up early in the morning and go into the street and fire off guns; and then the president or king or emperor, whoever he may be, says, “ Well, I guess I’ll let somebody else have my place—I don’t want it any more ”; and he goes off and travels and improves his mind, and somebody else takes his place. Sometimes the people are careless with their guns, and almost as many people get hurt as are hurt on the Fourth of July in America, but I think their way of managing things must be a great deal more fun than our elections. This is about all I know about Paris.
A . little after dark we came to a splendid street that was covered with plaster instead of paving-stones, and in this street we found the Grand Hotel.
We went in at the front door, and met somebody with gold lace around his hat, who by great good luck knew how to talk. I suppose he was a great general, or perhaps an admiral

I asked him if Henry Brown, Esq., was stopping at that hotel, and he said yes he was, and what do you want of him? I told him we had private business with Mr. Brown, and wanted to see him immediately; but the general laughed, and said Mr. Brown was at dinner, and we could leave our cards and call again. I said we would go right into the dining-room and see Mr. Brown, for he would much rather see us than have his dinner, but the general told us that we had better clear out and give him no more of our impudence. Just then a gentleman came up and spoke to him, and he left us alone for a minute.
The dining-room was very near to where we were, and we could see mornahundred people sitting at the table. I was very anxious to see father, so I said to Mike, “ Come on! let’s go right in, and I’ll introduce you to father.” “ All right!” said Mike. “ I’m game for to foller you,” and we both walked into the dining-room.
* A big fat waiter rushed up to us and tried to push us out, but I caught a glimpse of father and mother at the other end of the room, and I was determined to go in, and called to Mike to come on. Mike was a little cross, for the big waiter had hurt Mike’s sore hand, so he put his head down and ran at the waiter, and hit him so hard that he doubled up and howled. Then we ran as fast as we could to the end of the dining-room, and I 163

Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe put my arms around mother’s neck, and said, “ How are you, dear mother? Here we are at last, father!” And Mike stood close behind me, and whispered, “Say, Jimmy! shall I put me arrums around the ould jintleman?”
It was a joyful moment. Half the people at the table got up and crowded around us. Father and mother, after taking a moment to catch their breath, did seem real glad to see me. They got up from the table, and took Mike and me up to their room, and I told them all about our journey. And when I had got through, and mother was crying, father put his arm around me and said: “ When you are a little older you will know how dreadfully worried we were when we heard that you had run away; and you will prefer to endure almost anything rather than to make those who love you so wretched. Now, we’ll say no more about it, and you and Michael shall have a good bath and a dinner, and then go to bed.” He is the best and kindest father that ever lived.
