A SAILOR’S BRIDE
CHAPTER I
Philip Dudley, R.N., was certainly a good-looking young fellow. He was of medium height, as becomes a sailor, and his shoulders were sufficiently broad to give his figure an appearance of strength without any suspicion of clumsiness. The young ladies, God bless them, who may surely claim to be the best judges of such matters, were wont to declare that he looked as well out of his uniform as in it, and, as all the world knows, that is a greater compliment than can be paid to the general run of sailormen. His face was clean shaven, his hair curly, though closely cropped, while his eyes, which were blue, had an honest look in them that said something for the straightforward nature of their possessor. Whether he was destined to rise to any great position in the Service it was impossible to say; for the present, however, he was content to do his duty with a zeal which spoke for his affection for his calling, to obtain as much leave in every port as possible, and to dance and flirt as often as occasion and opportunity permitted.

“ Good-looking boy that navigating lieutenant of yours, Redfurn,” said his Excellency the Governor of Cape Colony to the Rear-Admiral as they stood together upon the dais at the further end of the ball-room at Government House, and surveyed the animated crowd below them. “ I like his face.”
“ He is a nice lad, and a promising officer,” the Admiral replied. “ Surely you remember J ack Dudley of the 83rd ? ”
“ The man who ran away with Lord Bellamy’s daughter at Secunderabad in ’71?” returned his Excellency with sudden interest “ Poor fellow, he was killed in the trenches at Tel-el-Kebir.”
“ The same,” the Admiral answered. “ Well, this lad is his son.”
“Egad! you don’t say so?” the Governor continued, regarding the youth with even greater interest. “Now I look at him more closely I can see the likeness. Well, his father was one of the best soldiers of our time, and certainly one of the most unfortunate. Poor Dudley, I should think I did remember him ! Redfurn, I must see more of that lad.”
The Admiral laughed pleasantly. “You had better look sharp about it, then,” he responded, “ for he will be off to sea directly. I have some information for the young rascal that will raise him to the seventh heaven of happiness, or I’m much mistaken.”
“In that case you shall tell him to-night. For his father’s sake the lad shall have an evening to remember.”

Turning to one of his aides, who was passing at the moment, the Governor gave him an instruction in an undertone. He was only just in time, for the waltz was over, and the dancers were promenading the room, or making their way into the verandahs in search of flirtation corners and a cooler atmosphere. A few minutes later the aide returned, accompanied by the young man of whom the Governor and Admiral had been speaking. He presented a fine, sailor-like figure as he approached the dais upon which the two men were standing.
“ My dear lad, how do you do ? ” said his Excellency, as he held out his hand. “ I have just learnt from the Admiral that you are the son of my old friend Jack Dudley. I wonder I did not recognize you before, for you are very like your father as I first remember him. You, I see, have patronized the rival service. By the way, I hope you have good news of your mother ? ”
A shadow flitted across the young man’s face. “ My mother is dead, sir,” he replied simply. ° She died last winter at Nice, after a short illness.”
“Dear me! dear me!” resumed the kind-hearted Governor in some confusion. Then he added with all the naivete of a schoolboy, “ I am sorry I gave you pain. And so you have lost your poor mother ? How proud your father was of her! As a matter of fact I believe I was at the identical dance at which they first saw each other. Such a pretty girl, and such a dancer too. It was no wonder Dudley fell in love with her. But I must not keep you; come and

see me again, my boy, and let us have a talk together. Now be off to your partners, but as you are strong, be merciful. Remember girls’ hearts are not like your own battleships; if you break them, they can’t be sent into dock for repairs.”
The young man bowed to the Governor, and was about to take his departure when the Admiral placed his hand upon his arm.
“ I don’t want to interfere with your amusements, Dudley,” he said in an undertone, “ but if you can spare me a few minutes later on, I think I have some news for you which will give you pleasure.”
“ I am at your service, sir, whenever you wish to speak to me,” the other replied.
The Admiral shook his head. “ No, no,” he continued, “there is no immediate hurry. What I have to say to you will keep for a little while. But if by any chance the ladies can spare you for a few minutes later on, come to me. Now be off about your business.”
The young man departed, wondering what it was that the Admiral desired to speak to him about His conscience remembered a certain little escapade in which he had been forced to play a part, very much against his will. But that had happened upwards of a month ago, and his common sense told him that it was scarcely likely, even if he had heard of it, that the Admiral would choose a dance at Government House as a place in which to inflict a wigging. His curiosity was certainly aroused.
He was entering the verandah in search of his

partner, when he was the recipient of a hearty smack upon the back.
“Whither away, so bold and gay, Duddy, my lad ? ” inquired the Torpedo Lieutenant of the flagship. “Did my eyes deceive me, or did I really see you conversing just now on terms of equality with the high gods? Duddy, beware of bad company. What did they want with you, old son ? ”
“ My advice as to the desirability of abolishing the rank of Torpedo Lieutenant,” Dudley answered with a chuckle. “The Admiralty seems to have come to the conclusion that it is stronger in theory than in practice.”
“ Very good, my lad,” retorted the other. “ I’ll teach you the use of a Torpedo Lieutenant when I get you aboard. But steady, who’s this coming across the room on the Attorney-General’s arm ? I thought I knew every girl in Cape Town, but I can’t remember having seen her before. By Jove, what a face and figure! She’s the most beautiful woman here to-night, and for the honour of the Service it is necessary that I should be introduced.”
He accordingly took his departure, leaving Dudley alone. The latter looked at the girl approaching him, and was compelled to confess that, never in his life before, had he seen so beautiful a creature. She was young, at most not more than one and twenty. Her height was slightly above that of the average woman; her figure was exquisitely moulded, while her face, which, as I have already said, was very beautiful, betrayed an amount of character that gave 5

it a distinction quite beyond the ordinary. Feeling that his attention might run the risk of being considered impertinent, Dudley was about to continue his search for his partner, when the Attorney-General hailed him.
“One moment, Mr. Dudley,*’ said the latter. “Permit me to have the pleasure of introducing you to Miss Erskine.” Then, when the young people had bowed to each other, he continued, “Lieutenant Dudley, I might tell you, Miss Erskine, is one of a band of charitable young men whom the Admiralty, with that consideration for which it is so justly famous, sends from place to place throughout the Empire in order that the British nation abroad may be kept au fait with the latest dances and methods of flirtation.”
The Attorney-General’s jokes were like himself, a trifle longwinded; but he was a genial man, and for this reason much was forgiven him.
“ I am afraid your programme must be very full at this hour of the evening, Miss Erskine,” said Dudley, when the other had finished his somewhat embarrassing remarks. “But if it is not too late may I solicit the pleasure of a dance ? ”
“ I have only just arrived,” the girl replied, offering him an empty programme in corroboration of the fact “ As you may judge from this, I am a comparative stranger in Cape Town.”
“ In that case,” returned Dudley, “ perhaps I may be allowed to put my name down for numbers twelve and fifteen ? ”

She acquiesced, and he wrote his name upon her card; and then, with a bow, passed on, having a settled conviction in his own mind that the two dances in question promised .to be among the most pleasant of the evening. A few moments later he found the partner for whom he had been looking, and learnt, with satisfaction, that she preferred to sit out the next number rather than to dance it. He was anxious to hear all that any one could tell him about the beautiful girl to whom he had just been introduced. He was, however, too old a campaigner to approach the matter abruptly. He accordingly addressed it from a side issue. Unfortunately, his diplomacy was of no use to him. His partner saw through his ruse, and regarded him with laughing eyes.
“Why don’t you tell me at once that you want to find out what I know about Miss Erskine?” she inquired, with a smile. “ I will tell you with pleasure. I am afraid it is not very much.”
“However little it be, it must necessarily be interesting," Dudley replied.
“That is a very pretty speech. To begin with, then, she is an orphan, and only arrived in the Colony from England six months ago. Her father was a Government contractor, I believe, and several times a millionaire, as you have probably heard ”— this was said with a little touch of malice. “ When she came out she went up-country to visit a school friend. For the present, that is to say, during the remainder of her visit, she is staying with her uncle,

Doctor Lampion, who I believe is her only relative in the world. You know Doctor Lampion, of course ? ”
"Very slightly,” Dudley acknowledged. "He dined with us on board one night, and I have met him a few times ashore.”
"And you don’t like him,” his partner continued. " Why are you not frank ? ”
“ Because I don’t know enough of him to either like or dislike him,” the young man replied.
" I wonder if I altogether agree with you ? ” the young lady answered. “ Perhaps you are not aware that I am supposed to be somewhat of a thoughtreader. By the way, would you like me to tell you your fortune, Mr. Dudley ? ”
" I should like it above all things,” he admitted, with a half wish that she would return to the subject of Miss Erskine. " Do you tell it by palmistry, by cards, or coffee beans ? ”
"By the hand, if you please,” she answered. " Show me your palm, and let me tell you what the Fates have in store for you ? ”
Dudley did as he was directed, and for upwards of a minute she studied his hand attentively.
"You are young and ambitious; you are also a rover.”
Dudley laughed. “ My face tells you the first,” he said; " the second is a foregone conclusion; my uniform answers for the third. You must be cleverer than that, fair wizard, if you would make me believe that it is in your power to reveal the secrets of the future.”

“ I have not finished yet,” the girl resumed. “ Let me look at your hand again. You have considerable administrative ability. You are not to be easily beaten. If you take a thing up, you like to carry it through.”
“ Unfortunately, that is all in the abstract. Now tell me something of my future.”
The girl once more bent over his hand.
“ You have been in love several times, but so far your heart has never been seriously affected. A change, however, is coming. You will fall in love with a tall woman with a beautiful face and fair hair. She will return your affection, but your love-making will at first be far from smooth You will part soon after your first meeting, and you will find each other again in a place that is far away. You will come very near losing your life, but you will not lose it, and when you die it will be as a rich man.”
“ The last is cheerful, at any rate,” said Dudley.
* You can’t tell me any more, I suppose ? ”
She shook her head. “ I can only read what is written upon your hand.”
“That is unfortunate. I should like to have heard a few more particulars. By the way, I think you said that the lady in question was to be tall, and was to have fair hair.”
“ That is as I read it,” she answered.
As she spoke they both looked up. By some strange chance Miss Erskine was passing at the moment
“ Tall and with fair hair,” said the girl at Dudley’s 9

side. “ Mr. Dudley, it seems as if this is going to be a memorable evening in your life.”
He was destined in after days to remember that speech. Fortunately for him, however, Providence has especially arranged that naval officers shall not take things too seriously. For this reason, when Dudley surrendered his clairvoyante to her chaperon, he did not think any more of what she had told him until he found himself searching the room for Miss Erskine.
“This is Number 12, I think,” he began, when he discovered her. “ Shall we dance it, or would you prefer to sit it out in the verandah ? ”
“I should like to dance it above all things,” she replied, rising from her chair.
He placed his arm round her waist, and they entered the revolving throng together. The waltz was the “Blue Danube,” an old favourite, and one that is gifted with perennial sweetness. As Dudley was soon to discover, Miss Erskine danced perfectly, while he himself was no mean adept at the art Round the room they circled, the young officer steering his fair partner over the glassy floor as dexterously as the vessels of his own squadron manoeuvre on the open ocean. One of her tiny hands rested on his arm, while the other was enclosed by his muscular fingers. With such a partner, he felt as if he could dance for hours. Then gradually, but with what seemed to be ever-increasing sweetness, the music died down, and finally ceased altogether.
“I cannot thank you enough,” said Dudley, as xo

they stopped. “ That is the best waltz I have had for years.” Then they left the ball-room together, and made their way to the cool verandah, where his fortune had been told half an hour before. Discovering a comfortable settee under a spreading palm, they seated themselves. “ I think you said that you have not been very long in Cape Colony, Miss Erskine,” her partner remarked, after they had been resting for upwards of a minute.
“I have been here nearly six months,” the girl replied, as she slowly fanned herself with her ostrich plume. “For the present I am staying with my uncle, Doctor Lampion. Perhaps you know him ? ”
“ I have met him once or twice,” Dudley answered. “ He is spoken of as being one of the coming men, I believe.” *
“ He is thought to be very clever,” she continued. “ I know that he is very ambitious. In his own mind, I believe, he aspires to something higher than colonial politics; he would like to try his chance in the great world at home. Perhaps some day he may do so. Are you ambitious, Mr. Dudley ? ”
There was almost a look of surprise in the young man’s face as she put the question.
“ It is strange that you should ask me that,” he said, “ for you are the second person who has spoken of my ambition this evening.”
“ Indeed!” she retorted. “That is very interesting. But of course you are ambitious; I can see it in your face. I always think that if a man does not determine at the outset of his career to win for

himself the highest place possible in the ranks of Fame, he is not likely to achieve any very great success. To be able to tell himself afterwards that he has conquered where others have failed, must be one of the proudest boasts imaginable.”
After this there was a little pause, during which Dudley contemplatively smoothed the back of his left hand with the first two fingers of his right. Then he looked up at Miss Erskine, and it was observable that his face was a little flushed.
“ It seems a strange request to make,” he began, “seeing that we have met this evening for the first time; but do you think I could get you to wish me success in my life’s undertaking, Miss Erskine? I know it’s rather cheek my asking it, but I have a sort of notion it would bring me luck.”
" I will wish you success with all my heart,” she answered, without either embarrassment or hesitation. “Go on and prosper, Mr. Dudley. You have all the world before you. But, hark! if I am not mistaken, there is the music for the next dance. Had we not better return to the ball-room ? ”
“ Perhaps we had,” returned the other, not however with an expression of pleasure upon his face.
They accordingly rose, and returned to the ballroom, where Dudley restored his partner to her chaperon. He had not been introduced to Miss Erskine more than an hour, and yet he could not help feeling convinced that, however absurd it might appear, he had met his fate. Having thanked her for the dance she had given him, he consulted his

programme, and then went off* in search of his partner, only to discover that she had met with an accident on the slippery floor, and had been compelled to return home. The dance having no attraction for him, here was his opportunity for his talk with the Admiral. He accordingly approached the daYs upon which the latter was seated in conversation with the Governor’s wife. Seeing him, the Admiral rose, and, when he had made his excuses to his hostess, advanced towards the young man.
“ Come along, Dudley,” he said. “ Let us discover a place where we can talk undisturbed. You need not look so anxious, my boy; I am not going to inflict a wigging, nor will I detain you very long.”
Having reassured the young man on these points, he led him across the room into an antechamber, where, having lighted upon a secluded corner, they seated themselves.
“ It was not my intention to say anything to you on this matter to-night,” he began; “ but his Excellency, who is an old friend of your father’s, particularly requested me to do so. Now, my lad, let me tell you that an occasion has arisen for enabling me to place considerable reliance upon you.”
“You pay me a great compliment, sir,” Dudley answered. “ I only hope I may prove worthy of it.”
“Unusual though it may be, I will go as far as to admit that I have no doubt upon that score,” replied the Admiral. “I might add that I have watched your career with great interest, and, taking one thing with another, I fancy I know my man. Now what 13

I have to say to you is of the utmost possible importance, and you must pay every attention to it.
I believe you are rather partial to an adventure in which there is a spice of danger ? Is not that so ? In that case I think I can give you as much as will satisfy you. Since you have been on this station I fancy you have heard of Achmet ben Hassein ? ”
“The Arab slave-dealer of Lake Nyassa ? ” Dudley inquired. “The man we have been trying for so long to catch ? Yes, sir, I have heard of him.”
“ Very good,” responded the Admiral. ” Then you must be aware that he is one of the most astute rascals in all Africa. He seems to know everything, and there can be no denying the fact that he has outwitted us at every turn. Information has to-day reached me that he is about to run a cargo of rifles up the Shird River into Lake Nyassa. At first his intention was to land them at Kiliman, but he has evidently received a hint that the Portuguese, generously minded in such matters, as they are, will not stand that. In consequence he has arranged to meet the vessel off Comoro Island, out of sight of land ; there he will tranship the arms and ammunition to his own dhow, after which he will smuggle them up to the Lakes as best he can. Now, unfortunately for us, while we have certain proof that the arms are on board the steamer in question, we have only hearsay and our own suspicions to tell us that they are intended for this man. Under these circumstances ^ it would be manifestly impolitic for us to stop the steamer and overhaul her on mere suspicion. All

we can do is to wait our opportunity, let them be transhipped to the dhow, and then, if Achmet is in command, seize her with the goods on board. But how is that to be managed ? For a hundred reasons it would be impossible to trust it to a native, and there is only one man in my fleet I feel justified in sending. Now it has occurred to me that you are an excellent hand at disguising yourself—never mind how I know it, it is sufficient that I do. As a matter of fact, I believe there was a certain little adventure in Zanzibar some six months ago that has never been properly explained. Well, never mind that now. You have also the advantage of being able to talk Arabic with sufficient fluency to escape detection. Now what would you say if I were to entrust the carrying out of this delicate bit of work to you. I will pay you the compliment, my lad, of saying that I believe if any man can bring this rascal to book, you are the one. D’you know, if I were a young man I should jump at the chance. What do you think about it ? ”
“I can only say,sir,”said Dudley, his face flushed with pleasure at the compliment the other was paying him, “ that I am sincerely grateful to you for having given me the opportunity. There is nothing I should like better. If you think, sir, that you can entrust the work to me, you may be sure I will do all I possibly can to bring it to a successful issue. If I should not succeed, I hope you will believe that I shall have done my best.”
* Whatever happens, I shall always do that,” the i5

Admiral answered. “Of course you must understand that the whole proceeding is very irregular—very irregular indeed. I am afraid, however, it is our only hope of catching the man. He has eluded us so often, and is such a slippery customer, that we are compelled to adopt any means we can think of to effect his capture. To allow the arms in question to be smuggled into the Lake country would be fatal to our interests, and would destroy the good work we have done there during the last five years.”
“And when is it necessary that I should start, sir ? ” Dudley inquired.
“ On Saturday, at latest,” the Admiral returned. “That is to say, in three days time. You are quite sure that you are willing to go ? Remember, you are under no compulsion. This is a voluntary matter. I give you a free hand to refuse, should you think proper.”
“You need not be afraid that I shall refuse, sir,” Dudley answered. “ I shall be ready to start as soon as you wish. But, sir, there is one thing that I do not quite understand. Supposing, luck favouring me, I get on board this dhow—and Achmet ben Hassein is certain to be very careful as to who he ships for his crew on a job like this—how shall I be in a position to seize her after he has got the arms aboard ? ”
“ I have arranged that to the best of my ability,” the Admiral replied. “ When you reach Mozambique you will call upon our consul, who knows all the insand-outs of the matter. He will find the necessary 16

man to go with you, and will also post you in all that transpires up to the moment of your going aboard. One word of advice, however: you must be more than careful, while you are in the place, not to attract much notice, for you may be quite sure Hassein will be on the watch. That is enough about the matter for the present To-morrow morning I will send for you again, and we will discuss it further. In the mean time be off to your partners, and enjoy yourself while you can, my lad. You won’t get much of this sort of thing in Mozambique.”
They rose and faced each other. There was a look of resolution upon the young man's countenance, and the Admiral smiled as he saw it
“ I hope, sir,” said Dudley, “ that you will believe how grateful I am to you for the confidence you have placed in me.”
* Tut, tut 1 ” laughed the Admiral. “ You needn’t say anything about that I only wish I was a young man and could go with you. It’s just the sort of thing I should have enjoyed.”
With that they returned to the ball-room, to discover that the next dance was about to commence. Dudley found his partner, and took his place with her in the set of lancers which was just forming.
“You seem very pleased about something, Mr. Dudley,” said she, as she noticed the radiant expression upon the other’s face.
“ How could I help being ?” he answered. “Am I not dancing with you ? ”
The young lady shook her pretty head. “I 17 c

thought we were too old friends to pay each other compliments,” she said.
At that moment Miss Erskine, who was dancing in a neighbouring set, looked across the room and happened to catch Dudley’s eye. The General’s daughter saw the look that passed between them, and her little heart sank in her breast. In the most secret recesses of that oft-abused receptacle she had cherished certain dreams, and her womanly instinct told her now that they never could be realized. By such little actions, seemingly so small and irrelevant, is decided the sorrow or happiness of a life.
Ten minutes later, when Dudley went in search of Miss Erskine, in order to claim his second dance, she admitted that she was tired, and suggested that they should sit the next number out. Nothing loth, Dudley consented, and they accordingly left the hot ball-room and strolled out into the cool verandah together. For some reason his companion was quieter than she had been on the previous occasion. There was a peculiar stand-offishness, a mute obstinacy, if I may so express it, about her manner that he had not seen before.
“I am afraid you are tired, Miss Erskine,” said Dudley at last, when the conversation had been flagging for some minutes.
“ I am afraid I must be,” she answered. “ To be called upon to make one’s self agreeable to people one has never seen before, and in whom one takes the least possible interest, exercises a decided strain upon the nerves.”

On hearing this, Dudley had to confess to himself that they had reached what the French very graphi-cally term an impasse.
“ I am, indeed, sorry you should have been bored,” he retorted a little coldly, as he stooped to pick up his programme which had fallen on the floor.
When he looked up again he saw that her eyes were filled with tears.
“Oh, Mr. Dudley, pray forgive me!” she said with great contrition. “ I don’t know what you must think of me for being so rude. I did not mean it, really I did not.”
Her sorrow was so unaffected that Dudley was disarmed at once.
“Of course I forgive you,” he answered. “I think there is a great deal of truth in what you say.” Then, as if he were anxious to divert the conversation into another channel, he continued with unwonted seriousness: “Has it ever struck you, Miss Erskine, how strangely people dodge in and out of each other’s lives? You may meet some one to-day in a quite haphazard fashion; for an hour or so you may possibly derive pleasure from his or her society; you feel that if you had a chance of knowing that person better it might result in your becoming firm and faithful friends ; then you shake hands in a casual way, and never meet again. He goes his way, becomes a wealthy merchant in Australia, an unsuccessful soldier in India, a rear-admiral, or what you will; eventually he is drowned at sea, dies on the Afghan frontier, or, more probably, finishes his career

like a respectable citizen in his four-post bed at home —and you are none the wiser. That is how you and I have met to-night I wonder if we shall ever see each other again. You are returning to England ? ”
“ In a fortnight,” she answered.
* And I say good-bye to Cape Town in three days.”
“Indeed,” she replied, with a look of surprise.
" Is the fleet leaving South Africa then ? ”
“ No,” he said. “ I am going away on special business. If you are leaving in a fortnight, I shall not see you when I return.”
* I hope you will have a very pleasant holiday,” she continued with what seemed almost an excess of sincerity, carefully studying the embroidery upon her fan as she spoke.
“ I am going on business,” he repeated, in a tone that suggested that he would not be leaving Cape Colony at all if he were not compelled to do so. “ It was not of my work I was thinking.”
“ Of what were you thinking, then ? ”
He paused for a moment, and carefully adjusted the sleeve-link in his shirt-cuff before he answered.
“ I was thinking,” he said, slowly and deliberately, “that, had it been possible, I should like to have been permitted an opportunity of seeing something more of you.”
His speech was so frank and sincere that it was impossible for her to be offended by it Her face, however, flushed crimson, and to hide her confusion she pretended to be interested in another couple seated under a palm further along the verandah,

“Really, Mr. Dudley,” she began at last, “you pay me a very great and unexpected compliment, but I fear----”
“You mean that the interest to which I referred has only one side. In that case I must beg your pardon for saying what I did. It was an unwarrantable liberty, and I do not wonder that you are angry with me.”
“You jump to conclusions too quickly,” she answered gravely. “ I was not thinking anything of the sort. I was merely wondering why you should wish to continue an acquaintance which you have only made within the last hour. Remember, you know nothing of me.”
As she spoke, the recollection of her vast wealth rose in Dudley’s mind. He was about to speak, but he checked himself. He was extremely sensitive, and the thought that she might imagine it was her money that made him so anxious to develop the acquaintance cut deep into his pride. To disclaim any such thought or intention was manifestly impossible. But in that case what a cur she must think him! He felt glad now that he was leaving Cape Town so soon. If ever love had flashed into being at first sight it had done so with him, and now there was nothing for it but to choke it down, to smother it as soon as it was born. Was not the barrier of her millions between them ? She noticed his hesitation, and a little smile flickered round the corners of her mouth.
“We have only known each other for about an hour, Mr. Dudley,” she said, “ and even on that small

introduction we are on the verge of a quarrel. It seems rather a waste of time, does it not ? Shall we fly a flag of truce, and forget that we have both said things we would wish unuttered ? ”
“ I am afraid I cannot agree to that proposal,” he answered, "and for the simple reason that I do not feel I have said anything I wish to retract.”
“ With me the opposite is the case,” she retorted. “ And as a result we are at cross purposes once more. But see, here is my uncle, Doctor Lampion, coming in search of me. He is not a dancing man, and I have no doubt he has grown weary of whist long since.”
" May I ask for one moment more, Miss Erskine?” said Dudley, hurriedly. " We have met, and we are going to part to-night. In all probability we shall never see one another again. I wonder if you would think me insane if I were to put one last question to you ? ”
She answered with a little nod. "That would depend very much upon the question, would it not ? What is it ? ”
"Will you promise me that you will give me a candid answer ? ”
" I will endeavour to do so.”
"In that case I want you to suppose for one moment that it is within the sway of chance that we may some day meet again.”
“ I am quite willing to suppose that,” she answered with a smile. " What then ? ”
“ If the choice were given you, would you decide in favour of continuing our acquaintance or not ? ”

“ Yes, provided that you promised not to quarrel with me, as you have tried to do to-night, I think I might decide in favour of continuing it,” she replied, smiling at him over the top of her fan. 11 Will that satisfy you ? Now, here is my uncle. It is evident we are going home.”
When Doctor Lampion joined them, she said, “You know Mr. Dudley, I think?”
“ I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Dudley,” the other returned, holding out his hand.
The two men looked at each other, and, as they did so, something told them that it would never be possible for them to be friends.
“ Good night, Miss Erskine,” said Dudley.
“ Good night,” she replied. " I hope you will be successful in the business that is taking you away, and that you will have good news to tell me when next we meet”
How little either of them guessed when, and under what circumstances, that meeting was destined to take place!

CHAPTER II
On the morning following the dance at Government House, Dudley received an order to wait upon the Admiral at eleven o’clock. There is no necessity for me to describe the ofRcial residence of the Commander-in-Chief in South African waters, for the reason that every one who has visited the capital of Cape Colony must be familiar with it. Dudley himself had been there many times before, but, needless to say, he had never entered its doors upon such a curious errand as that which now occasioned his call. He was saluted at the gates by that retired son of the sea who knows as much of men and things naval as even the Admiralty itself, and who informed him that, at the moment of speaking, the Admiral was to be found smoking a cigar in the front verandah.
With that innate courtesy which is one of his leading characteristics, and which has made his name honoured throughout both hemispheres, the latter rose from his chair and accorded the young man a cheery welcome.
“ Good morning, Dudley,” he said. “ I am glad to see you looking so fresh after your exertions of

last night! Nothing seems to tire you young fellows.”
When the other had declared that he felt no worse for his dissipation, he followed the Admiral into the house, and for upwards of an hour they were closeted together in the study, poring over charts and papers. It was then that the young man learnt all the ins and outs of the intricate business upon which he was to be engaged. So complete was his attention, that when he rose to leave he was thoroughly grounded in every particular of the scheme he was to carry out; knew exactly how far her Majesty’s Consul in Mozambique would be able to help him, and what he was to do in the event of certain contingencies arising.
“In conclusion, bear one thing always in mind, Dudley,” continued the Admiral with great seriousness. “ When you get to Mozambique don’t be too precipitate. Don’t attempt to rush matters. One little mistake in that direction may upset all our calculations, and do more harm even than the importation of the arms themselves into the Lake Territory.”
“I will be very careful, sir,” the young man replied. “ And when the dhow is my prisoner I am to make sail for Zanzibar—hand her over to the authorities, and wait there until the flagship puts in an appearance.”
“ Exactly,” the Admiral answered. “ We should reach Zanzibar, if all goes well, within a few days, or a week at the latest, of your arrival. Should we not

find you there, we shall continue our cruise until we pick you up. As for the remainder of your instructions, I will let you have them in writing in order that you may study them at your leisure. When you are sure that you have mastered them, they had better be destroyed, lest by any chance they should fall into other hands. Do you follow me ? ”
“ I understand exactly, sir,” Dudley answered.
The grey eyes under the bushy brows looked at him approvingly. This was a young man after his own heart; in his youth the Admiral had been just such another. He was about to say something to this effect; but he remembered the sanctity and solitariness of his position, and checked himself in time. He rose and held out his hand.
“ You had better see Matthews at once, and after you have done so book your passage by the Deutsche Ost Afrika’s steamer leaving on Saturday next. In the mean time, if you should want a couple of days’ leave, I have no doubt it could be managed.”
Dudley thanked the Admiral and withdrew. He did not stand in any particular need of leave just then, but he was not going to refuse it since it had been offered to him.
That afternoon Fate, which is more concerned in these things than many people imagine, lured him into a certain club of which he had been for some time a member. It was a warm afternoon, and he discovered that he stood in need of refreshment. Accordingly he entered the smoking-room and rang the bell, and when he had given his order to the 26

servant, seated himself in a bamboo chair, stretched his legs out on the foot-rest, lit a cigarette, and settled himself down to think over his interview with the Admiral. He had scarcely entered upon the first stage of it, however, before the door behind him opened and another man entered the room. The new comer, whoever he was, crossed to the fireplace and rang the bell, not gently, as if he were anxious to spare the nerves of the attendants, but irritably, as if he were in a hurry and would stand no trifling. Having done so, he went to a table in the further corner, where the files of papers reposed, and after he had selected one from the heap, was about to ensconce himself in an easy-chair when he realized that he was not the sole occupant of the chamber.
“ Ah ! Mr. Dudley,” he said, with a curt little nod. “How do you do? Nasty day outside, isn’t it?” As he said this, he moved from the chair he had first chosen, to one somewhat nearer the man he addressed. There was a certain significance in the action that did not escape the other’s notice. “I hope you enjoyed the dance at Government House last night? Plenty of people there ! ”
“More than usual, I fancy,” said Dudley, in a tone which suggested that he was only answering for politeness’sake. “I trust Miss Erskine was not very tired ? ”
“She has not complained to me,” her uncle replied. “She is not like that. Some women are so deuced unreasonable ; they dance themselves into a collapse, and then win for themselves the reputation

of a domestic martyr, in as much as they don’t complain. I could give you a dozen instances, if necessary.”
Then, taking up his paper, he studied it with an attention that looked very much as if he had changed his mind and were anxious to limit the conversation to as few words as possible.
He was admittedly a curious specimen of the genus mant was Wilfred Lampion. The fault was not altogether his own, for half South Africa had declared that he was more than ordinarily clever; and that sort of indiscriminate praise is fatal. A big authority had said so in a moment of mental aberration, and the rest had followed his lead like sheep : in certain circles it was supposed to be the correct thing to say. There were some people, however, —there always will be, I suppose—who out-heroded Herod, and added that, had it not been for certain untoward circumstances, which combined to render him a poor man, Wilfred Lampion would have been one of the most distinguished of our fellow residents upon the planet When, however, these enthusiastic admirers were put to the test, and were challenged to declare in what way Doctor Lampion showed himself superior to his neighbours, they were compelled to admit that their powers were insufficient to the task. The truth lay in a somewhat narrow channel Lampion was ambitious to his finger tips; he was also a man boasting a decided personality. Providence had given him the fatal power of making other people believe that he was cleverer than he 28

really was, and this was the cause of half the trouble. He was an easy and fluent speaker, an excellent debater, and, what was infinitely more to his advantage, he had the faculty of being able to carry conviction in his voice, when his words, set down in matter of fact print, were quite inadequate to the task. He was the possessor, moreover, of a somewhat caustic wit, which he was wont to use with effect upon such of his adversaries as displeased him; a fact which rendered them chary of offending him. To complete the portrait, it might be added that the proportion of his friends lay amongst the more excitable section of the female community, and the shallower members of the male, while with men and children he found few if any admirers. Such of them as were capable of judging saw through him, while the younger strata of the population discovered in him, with an instinct that only children possess, something that was not always sincere, and for this reason they stood aloof while their elders sang his praises and talked of the brilliant future that was to dawn for him some day. He was tall, somewhat above the middle height, partially bald, possessed a high forehead, a somewhat sharp nose, and a drooping moustache which entirely covered his mouth. His appearance was always neat and natty, and he had earned the reputation of being one of the best dressed men in the Colony, a fact to which, by the way, he attached no small importance.
But I have wandered from the point. Having partaken of his refreshment, glanced casually through

the paper, and smothered a yawn, Lampion dropped the file upon the floor, and turned to his companion.
“ How I envy you your chance of getting away,” he began simply and unaffectedly, knocking the ash off his cigarette against the arm of his chair as he spoke. “ I suppose your .only regret is that it isn’t England ? ”
Dudley was so taken aback at the abruptness, as well as the appositeness of the question, that he was for the moment tongue-tied. How had the other arrived at the knowledge that he was going away at all? And why did he mention it at that minute? His surprise was only momentary, however, for a moment later he remembered the fact that Lampion had been standing beside them, on the previous evening, when Miss Erskine had wished him a pleasant journey and success in the enterprise upon which he was embarking.
“ I’m afraid we shan’t go home for another year, or possibly eighteen months,” he said at last. “ We’re comparatively new on the station, you see ! ”
His reply must have somewhat disappointed his auditor, for the latter was silent for upwards of a minute, and sat slowly inhaling the cigarette he held in his hand, and peering at the ceiling as if he expected to derive some sort of inspiration from what he saw there. Then he sucked his moustache and recrossed his legs.
“ Have you travelled by the Deutsche Ost Afrika’s line before ? ” he inquired casually.
“The Deutsche Ost Afrika’s line?” Dudley

repeated, as if he did not quite grasp the purport of the question that had been put to him. * No, I have never travelled by that line. I am told they do you rather well. Do you know them ? ”
“ I went up in one of their boats as far as Mozambique a year ago,” the other replied. “ What a rat-hole it is I I suppose you know Burton there ? Big man—red hair—agent for the Dark Continent Development Company.”
“ I have met him,” Dudley answered, without any enthusiasm. “ He was going home on leave the last time I was there.”
“He is back now,” returned Lampion, glancing complacently at his boots. “ I had a letter from him the other day. If you happen to run across him, remember me to him, will you ? ”
“You seem to have come to the conclusion that I am going up the East Coast,” said Dudley, after a moment’s pause. “ What put that notion into your head?"
“I am sure I don’t know,” Lampion replied. “You may have told my niece, and possibly she told me.”
Now, Dudley was quite certain that, while he had said that he was leaving Cape Town, he had not told Miss Erskine in which direction he was travelling. As a matter of fact, he had been particularly careful not to do so. He was aware how news travels, and how eager people are to know the private affairs of every one else and to profit by them. For this reason he looked at Lampion a little more intently

than before ; the latter’s face, however, was innocence itself—so much so that the other began to think he might have been mistaken. It was impossible the man could have any reason for pumping him. And yet, on the other hand, there could be no sort of doubt that, whatever Dudley’s future movements might be, they interested the doctor more than was consistent with his pretended indifference. He was still exercising his mind on this subject, when the other rose from his seat and prepared to leave the room. Before he went, however, he turned to Dudley in what was intended to appear a casual way, but had still a touch of arrangement in it.
“ I was going to ask you,” he said, “ if you have not left Cape Town, to lunch with us on Sunday next I am sure my niece, Miss Erskine, would be very pleased to see you, and I need not say how much pleasure it would give me.”
His tone and manner was simplicity itself, but the keen eyes watching Dudley from beneath the overhanging brows belied the impression he intended his words to convey.
" I am not sure whether it will be possible for me to come,” Dudley answered. “ If I am in Cape Town I shall be delighted. Would you mind very much if I leave it an open question until to-morrow ? I shall be able to tell better then.”
“ Leave it by all means,” Lampion returned. “ If I don’t hear from you to-morrow I shall presume you will be able to come. We lunch at two, and I fancy you know my house.”

Considering that Dudley had passed it twice that day, and that he had looked up. at the windows on each occasion, in the hope of catching a glimpse of Miss Erskine, it was more than probable that he did know it. He accordingly answered in the affirmative, and then, with an affable nod, Doctor Lampion put on his helmet and left, the room. Dudley thereupon lit another cigarette and settled himself down to consider the conversation they had had together.
“ I wonder what the deuce is the reason of it all ? ” he began to himself. ° Why on earth is he so anxious to find out whether I am going up the East Coast or the West, and when I sail ? It’s all bosh his saying that Miss Erskine told him I was going to Mozambique. I never told her anything of the sort, and he knows it. 1 must confess I should like to know what his little game is.”
He shook his head solemnly over the problem, and then passed on to another train of thought. He was quite convinced in his own mind, by this time, that Miss Erskine was the most beautiful girl he had ever met; he was also prepared to endow her at short notice with an assortment of the other virtues. It became necessary for him to recall her face, the colour of her eyes, the shape of her head, and the picture she had presented, as she sat fanning herself under the big palm in the verandah at Government House, before he could properly understand his feelings towards her. The thoughts thus engendered were evidently of a pleasant nature, for he was encouraged to greater efforts. For away in the heart 33	o

of the New Forest, in distant England, Dudley possessed a small property, left him by his mother, comprising a delicious old Elizabethan manor-house, and a demesne of perhaps a couple of dozen acres. When he married, if ever he did, this was where he would settle down. To indicate the wild flights of a young man’s fancy, I might add that he even went so far as to picture Mary Erskine descending the old oak staircase to greet him on his return from a day’s shooting or hunting. Carried away by the success of the picture he had succeeded in painting for himself, he went even further—planned certain alterations to the house; threw out a boudoir here and a conservatory there, and was going even further, when the door behind him opened and two men entered the room. They were plainly in search of some one, and it soon became evident that that some one was Dudley himself. One of them was Bradford, the Torpedo Lieutenant of his own ship—the same who had been so struck by Miss Erskine’s beauty on the previous evening; the other was Percivale of the Andromeda.
“ Run to earth at last, Duddy my lad,” said the former, clapping him enthusiastically upon the back. <( We’ve been hunting high and low for you. What have you been doing ? ”
“ Enjoying a well-earned rest,” Dudley replied lazily. “Eve got two days’ leave, and I’ve been trying to put in some of it in this armchair. What do you want with me ? ”
"We’ve got an invitation for you,” the Torpedo
34

Lieutenant’s companion replied. “The Pontefract Castle is in, and Dick Poynder is on board, on his way home. We saw him in the street just now, and he wanted to know if we three could come down and dine with him on board. What do you say ? ”
“ I’d like it above all things,” Dudley answered. “ So Poynder’s going to have a holiday after all?”
“ I should rather think he is,” returned the Torpedo Lieutenant, seating himself on the arm of Dudley’s chair. “ He’s going home for the first time for twelve years. I gathered from what he said, that as soon as he reaches London he intends investing his savings in paint wherewith to daub the Metropolis red. I can imagine I see him doing it”
The dinner on board the mailboat that evening was a merry one in more senses than one. The Honourable Richard Poynder, third and youngest son of the Earl of Wimperdon, had been located for twelve years on a certain island on the East Africa coast, where he had gained experience in a variety of diseases, had learnt to distinguish between the vagaries of the Arab and the villainies of the uneducated Swahili, to swear in a variety of dialects, and to forswear that liquor which had originally brought him low, and which now meant all the difference between life at midday and death at sundown.
“By Jove! I can’t believe that I am really going home,” he said, as he led his guests to the purser’s cabin prior to their leaving the vessel. “It seems
35

too good to be true. How I wish you boys were coming ! Lummy, what larks we would have! ”
“No such luck for us,” said the Torpedo Lieutenant, lugubriously. “ We are booked out here for goodness only knows how long. For two pins I’d cut the service and settle ashore. Oh, why doesn’t some nice girl with money come along and marry me! I’m sure I’m capable of making her very happy.”
‘‘I’ve half a mind to get married while I’m at home,” said Poynder, reflectively, as he crawled into the purser’s bunk and sat there swinging his legs, looking down upon his friends and the world in general. “A girl with five thousand a year would just suit me. Why don’t you get spliced, Duddy ? ”
“ Duddy has missed his opportunity,” the Torpedo Lieutenant answered. “Last night, at Government House, he was as thick as thick could be with a girl with millions. Why on earth did you let the chance slip, old man? You should have proposed on the spot.”
“ Bradford’s an ass,” retorted Dudley, by way of explanation. “He is jealous because the lady had the good taste to prefer a navigating to a torpedo lieutenant.”
“You fellows have all the luck,” Poynder went on, with a sigh. “ Girls with millions don’t come my way. Who is the particular specimen ? ”
Dudley endeavoured to change the conversation, but Bradford, upon whom the wine he had drunk at dinner was beginning to take effect, forestalled him.

“ She’s a Miss Erskine,” he replied ; w and when you’ve said that you’ve said everything. She came out in the Carrickfergus about six months ago. She’s an awfully pretty girl, and, what’s more, I believe there is no doubt about the money.”
“ If that’s so, I’ve a good mind to wait here for the next boat,” remarked Poynder. “ It’s plain that you fellows don’t know the value of your chances. Who are her friends hereabouts ? ”
“She is staying with her uncle—Lampion the doctor—man they say is going to be no end of a swell some day.” .
“Lampion’s niece, is she?” Poynder inquired with sudden interest. “Rum beggar that same Lampion. You mark my words, he’ll come an awful cropper before long.”
“ How do you mean ? ” Dudley asked.
“ I mean that he’ll come to smash, because there’s more in him than meets the eye,” the other replied. “ I could tell you a funny story about him. I rather fancy, if some of his admiring friends down here knew all the ins and outs of his career, they’d be a bit surprised.”
“ What on earth do you mean ? Don’t talk in riddles, man. Tell us straight out.”
“ I mean—well, do you remember that nasty little bit of business connected with those Arab dhows a degree or so to the westward of Mfuka about eighteen months ago ? ”
“Of course we do,” Dudley replied, with an interest that he could not conceal. “What about it?”

“Well, when Pierney went through the papers that were discovered in the chief’s possession afterwards, he found----- But there, perhaps I’d better not say anything about it, after all. Mustn’t talk out of office hours, you know, especially when I’ve sunk the shop for twelve months.”
“ That’s so like Dick,” said the Torpedo Lieutenant “He raises our curiosity to fever-heat and then refuses to gratify it What secretive beggars these political agents are, to be sure! Duddy, my lad, it strikes me it’s about time we went ashore. Little Percivale here is very nearly asleep. He’s young, and late hours don’t agree with him.”
Ten minutes later they were ashore, Poynder accompanying them, in order to see that they did not loiter on the homeward journey. Leaving the wharf, they passed into the town. It was growing late, and in consequence but few people were abroad. Suddenly Poynder discovered that the thirst of which he had tried so hard to rid himself at dinner had returned, and he declared that he would know no peace until it had been quenched.
“ Something deep and cool I must have at once,” he said. “Bradford shall guide us. Torpedo lieutenants are invariably well informed.”
“ My dear fellow, you must either come up to the club with us, or return to your own boat. This is only a small pothouse for sailors.”
“And that is exactly what I want,” Poynder answered. “ What is good enough for the mercantile marine of England is good enough for me. Besides,

we may have an adventure. Dudley, you would not desert an old friend. Come along, this looks like the sort of place.”
They were standing before a mean-looking hostelry of the sort usually frequented by firemen and seamen of vessels lying in the docks. It was not a prepossessing place by any manner of means, and Dudley and the other men did their best to persuade Poynder to abandon his idea of entering it Their endeavours were in vain, however. He had made up his mind, and was not to be turned from his resolution. Under these circumstances there was nothing for it but to accompany him.
“ If he goes in there in his present position, they’ll have every cent he’s got on him,” said Dudley. * Confound the fellow! why did he come ashore with us?”
Poynder had meanwhile discovered a side door, and had entered the building before the men could stop him. They accordingly followed him down a dark passage towards a room at the further end, whence a light streamed forth. The front bar was filled with men, and from the angry voices that proceeded from it, it appeared as if a fight were imminent The room they were approaching was evidently reserved for captains, mates, and a better class of company. It consisted of a small bar, a couple of tables, and a few well-worn easy chairs. When they entered it was not occupied, but they had not been there more than a minute before a tall, good-looking young woman made her appearance from a room at 39

the back and asked the customers’ requirements. While she was serving them her eyes fell upon Poynder. A little exclamation of surprise escaped her, and then, without another word, she put down the bottle she held in her hand and left the room.
“Good gracious!” exclaimed Poynder, “I know that girl. Where on earth did I see her last ? ”
He tried to cudgel his brains, but his efforts were in vain. He was still puzzling over it when a man appeared through the door by which the girl had left, and took possession of the bar.
“ I must find that young woman and discover why she cleared out in that mysterious fashion,” Poynder began, moving towards the door. “ I told you when we came in that we should meet with an adventure. You can see from that the sort of prophet I am.”
So saying, he left the room.
“ This won’t do at all,” said Dudley. “ He’ll get himself and us into trouble if he’s not careful. I’ll go after him and see if I can bring him back.”
He accordingly went off in search of Poynder.
As I have said, the passage was only dimly lighted. On either side of it were doors, one of which was standing open a few inches. Near this door Dudley paused. Not a sign could he see of the man he was in search of. Suddenly he gave a little start. From the room with the open door there issued a voice which he could not help recognizing. There was no mistaking it. It belonged to the man who had

spoken to him at the club that afternoon—to Miss Erskine’s uncle, Doctor Lampion.
“ No, no,” he was saying; “ it’s too great a risk— far too great a risk.”
“ Risk or no risk, it’s your only chance,” another deep voice replied. “Besides, when you come to think of it, where does the risk come in ? You say you must have the money ? ”
There was a little pause.
“ Must have the money ? Of course I must have it. You know that; it’s life and death to me. If I don’t find it my career is ruined. People will discover everything, and just when I’ve got my foot on the highest rung of the ladder, I shall be toppled down again. Come what may, I must find it somewhere— but where ? ”
“ You can only find it by falling in with my plans,” the same deep voice continued. ‘‘You’re quite sure the will is in your favour ? ”
“ I have the best of reasons for knowing that it is.”
“ Then you must do as I propose ; but remember always that my price is fifty thousand pounds. I will not run the risk for a penny less.”
“What will your risk be compared with mine ? ”
“At any rate, it will be enough for me. Shut that door. It’s leaving doors ajar that hangs people.”
At this moment there was the sound of some one moving in the room, and Dudley had only just time to hide himself before the door was opened and some 4i

CHAPTER III
Looked at from the sea there are few places, if any, on the East African coast, that present a more picturesque outward appearance than does the island of Mozambique. From the handsome old fortress of San Sebastian at one end, to the cemetery and fort of San Lorenzo at the other, it is all an artistic conglomeration of colour. By order of the authorities it is forbidden to paint one’s house pure white, a small thing seemingly, but one which assumes imposing proportions when it is remembered that by this means the eyes of Europeans are protected, and their sight preserved much longer than would be the case if the dwellings of the inhabitants were all one dazzling white. The result, however, is apt to be somewhat bewildering, for the colours chosen by the occupants are, in many cases, such as would drive an artist, with a general scheme in his head, to despair. It is also a fact to be deplored that the solicitude for the general welfare is not carried further in other and more necessary directions. At the western end of the island a cemetery exists, the arrangements connected with which are, when they permit themselves to think of it, of a nature calculated 43

to excite the wildest apprehension on the part of all but those who have ceased to take interest in things connected with this life. Indeed, it has been remarked by many that—but there, perhaps it would be better to draw the curtain. Least said is soonest mended, if one may believe the proverb, so let us return to the pleasanter and more picturesque side of Mozambique.
If the traveller approaching the island from the sea, is favourably impressed by the prospect presented to him there, he is likely to be even more so when he sets foot ashore. A handsome promenade, shaded by umbrageous trees, reaches from one end of the island to the other. The public offices are in some cases almost noteworthy, while the Governor’s Palace, the old Cathedral, the British Consulate, the Bishop’s House, and the New Custom’s Buildings are by no means to be despised. It is true that the flat roofs, the dhows at anchor in the harbour, the variety of costume—and perhaps the lack of it—in the streets ashore, give the place an Oriental air, but there are times when Mozambique can be very European.
It was a little before sunset on a glorious evening that the Deutsche Ost Afrika’s boat sighted the island. Twenty-three miles to the west-nor-west rose Pao Mountain, with Meza Mountain looking up some eighteen or twenty miles to the northward. After that, the islands of St. George and St. Jago came into view, then Fort Sebastian, and finally the town itself. Dudley was on deck at the time, stretched out in a long cane-chair under the awning. On hearing from

an old Portuguese priest, who had been sitting beside him, that the town was in sight, he rose and went to the bulwarks to look at it. He had touched at Mozambique in his own ship on one or two occasions, but never had he thought of doing so in such a strange capacity as this. He wondered what the upshot of it all would be ? Would Achmet ben Hassein permit him an opportunity of getting on board the dhow, and if he did, would he be successful in the task he hoped to accomplish ? In any case he was determined not to draw back. The Admiral had shown the trust he reposed in him, and he was going to let him sec that it was not misplaced. A quarter of an hour later the steamer was at anchor, and as soon as the necessary formula had been complied with, Dudley was at liberty to go ashore. He accordingly collected his baggage, and having chartered a boat, found himself, in something less than a quarter of an hour, standing upon the wharf opposite the Governor’s Palace. He was immediately surrounded by the usual crowd of jabbering niggers, who clamoured, and in some instances fought, for the possession of his bag. Having decided upon one, apparently less villainous than the rest, he gave him his marching orders, and followed in his wake to the British Consulate.
“ My dear Mr. Dudley, how do you do ? ” said the Consul, when his guest was admitted to his presence. “This is a very unexpected pleasure. I thought you were in Cape Town !”
“ I am the bearer of a letter to you from Admiral 45

Redfurn,” Dudley answered. “ You will find that it explains the reason of my presence here.”
He took from his pocket the letter the Admiral had given him and handed it to the Consul, who opened it and read it through two or three times most carefully, locking it in a drawer of his writingtable as soon as he had mastered its contents.
"I need scarcely tell you that this is a very difficult and, I might also add, a very desperate business upon which you have engaged yourself,” he said, looking intently at the young man as he replaced the keys in his pocket; ° a very dangerous business indeed.”
" No one is more aware of that fact than myself,” Dudley returned. “ Believe me, I am going into it with my eyes open. If you can help me, I shall be more obliged to you than I can say. I understand from the Admiral that I may count upon your co-operation.”
The other was silent for upwards of a minute.
“ It is my duty of course to help you,” he said, at length, “and you may rest assured that I shall do so to the very best of my ability. At the same time, I cannot help thinking that you are running too great a risk. The man in question is a desperate fellow. He knows that he is very nearly at the end of his tether, and that if he falls into our hands nothing can possibly save him. If by any chance he should discover your identity, your life will not be worth five minutes’ purchase.”
“ I am fully conscious of that fact,” Dudley replied, 46

“and it makes me the more eager to effect his capture.”
“ In that case I need say no more,” the Consul returned. “ Let us postpone consideration of the matter for a while. As the Admiral says in his letter, there is nothing to be gained by haste; and, if I am to help you, it will be necessary for me to act with great circumspection. In the mean time, let me have the pleasure of introducing you to Mrs. Spurfield. I do not think you have ever met.”
So saying, he led the way from the office up to the flat roof of the house, where his wife was sitting at her needlework.
Few, if any, more charming ladies have dwelt upon the African coast than the wife of Consul Spurfield, and many indeed are the hearts that respond to the mere mention of her name. Hidden away in a drawer in her own room, I happen to know that there are a number of letters from grateful women in England—mothers, sweethearts, and sisters of men, who, stranded, sick, and dying on a lee shore, had been nursed by her, and whose last moments were soothed by her gentle ministrations.
“ Let me introduce Mr. Dudley to you, my dear,” said her husband, as they approached her. “ He has just arrived from Cape Town, and I have persuaded him to give us the pleasure of his company for a few days.”
As he said this, he made a sign to her not to ask questions as to the young man's business in Mozambique.

* We shall be very pleased if you will stay with us,” she replied, in her motherly tone. * It is always a great pleasure to us to entertain any of our own countrymen; we see so few. You arrived in the Deutsche Ost Afrika’s boat this afternoon, I suppose ?”
Dudley answered in the affirmative, and then, after the fashion of dwellers on the East Coast, they proceeded to discuss the merits and demerits of the various lines touching at the island. The sun had sunk to his rest long since, and the view from the housetop at the moment was an exceedingly picturesque one. Between the palms and the houses they caught glimpses of the blue harbour, with the mailboat lying well out from shore, and the dhows clustered, like evil-looking sea-birds, a short distance from her.
After dinner they returned to the house-top, where they sat conversing on many topics until a late hour. Finally, Mrs. Spurfield, feeling that they must have something of a private nature to say to each other, rose and bade them good night; after which the Consul drew his chair a little closer to that occupied by his guest
“You will be interested to hear that I have already advanced one step in the direction in which you are anxious to proceed,” he said, smoothing the leaf of his cigar as he did so.
“You have not lost much time,” Dudley replied. “The sooner it comes off the better I shall be pleased. May I ask what you have done ? ”

“Well, to begin with, I have discovered the whereabouts of a certain man; the very one of all others who would be most likely to be useful to you.”
“That is indeed a step in the right direction. And who may he be ? ”
“His name is Samweli. He is a Swahili by birth, and a wanderer up and down the coast by profession. A better man for this particular work I do not think you could find. He is honest, trustworthy, obedient, and as brave as a lion. What is more, though the latter is not aware of the fact, he hates Achmet ben Hassein with a deadly hatred. I have sent an order to him to come here to-night, and, as it is getting late, I have no doubt he will soon put in an appearance. When he comes you had better leave the conduct of arrangements to me.”
Ten minutes later Spurfield’s servant ascended to the roof to inform his master that Samweli had arrived. The man in question was accordingly conducted to their presence. He proved to be a splendid specimen of his race. His height could scarcely have been less than six feet; his hair was crisp, short, and curly—the usual top covering, in fact, of the Zanzibari; his muscular development would have put to shame many of the most famous strong men, and as a result his strength was that of a giant. When he entered the room he smiled graciously, with that large-hearted smile that is the peculiar property of the African.
“You speak Swahili, Mr. Dudley, I believe?” said Spurfield.

M Very fairly/’ the other replied.
“That is fortunate,” said the Consul. “At the same time it is a fact worth remembering that our friend Samweli here talks as many languages, or perhaps I should say as many dialects, as he has fingers on his hands. Is not that so ? ”
Samweli treated them to another of his amiable smiles, at the same time insinuating that what Mr. Spurfield had said was in accordance with fact
* Let us proceed, then,” said the Consul. * It may be that you have heard of Achmet ben Hassein— Samweli ? ”
The negro grunted an acquiescence. The expression upon his face had changed, and now was by no means pleasant
“ Well, Samweli,” continued Mr. Spurfield, “ information has reached me that Achmet ben Hassein is about to make an attempt to smuggle guns and powder up to the Lakes. It is my will that he shall not do this thing. Do you understand ? ”
Once more Samweli grunted. It looked as if there would be an opportunity of getting even with his enemy at last
“ Now the man of whom we speak has a dhow, and in this dhow he will meet a steamer near Comoro Island. He will take the guns and other things from her, land them on the coast, and afterwards carry them up the river. He must not do this thing. If he is caught, and the arms are taken, there will be great reward. Where is the dhow ? ”
Samweli replied that he did not know, but

that if he were given time he might be able to find out
“ Go; search quickly, and bring me word again,” said the Consul. “ Find out when he will leave and who goes with him. This Englishman, my friend, is an officer of the Queen, whom I serve; he must sail on board the dhow, and you must go with him. Between you, you must capture Ben Hassein and carry the dhow to Zanzibar. But remember this, if Achmet should discover what is in our minds there will be cutting of throats, so be swift and secret When you have news return again to me, but do not let them know that you come. As you act in this matter so will I deal with you hereafter. Now go! ”
When the Swahili had left them the Consul turned to Dudley.
“ That is the man upon whom you will have to depend for your life,” he said. ‘‘He is as sharp-witted as any man along the coast So far, I fancy, the Arab does not suspect him, but when they find each other out it will be war to the knife. And now shall we say good night? It is growing late, and there is much to do to-morrow.”
So saying, he conducted Dudley to his bedroom, and at the door shook hands with him.
f< Let me say, once and for all,” he remarked, as they clasped hands, “that I do not envy you the task you have set yourself. It is a good thing for you that you have no one dependent upon you. If you had a wife and children, I fancy you would think differently about it. Good night”

“Good night,” answered Dudley, and then went into his bedroom and shut the door.
He undressed himself slowly. Spurfield’s last remark had raised a curious train of thought in his mind. Ever since that evening when he had dined on board the Pontefract Castle at Cape Town, he had been pondering over the curious conversation he had had the good fortune, or the misfortune, to overhear in the public-house near the Docks. Its real meaning he was still at a loss to understand, but that Doctor Lampion had been one of the speakers he had never entertained any sort of doubt Several things puzzled him about the affair. If the doctor were so hard pressed for money, as might naturally be inferred from his remarks on that occasion, what course was he adopting to secure it? Whose will was it he was so certain had been made in his favour and why had he been so reluctant to fall in with the mysterious scheme his companion had proposed for refilling his pockets. That he was an intensely ambitious man Dudley had long been aware, that he was invariably impecunious, and was reputed to be not over-scrupulous as to how he obtained his money, were other traits that, to a certain extent, had become matters of public gossip. Dudley could not hide from himself the knowledge that he entertained a great admiration for Miss Erskine. As he thought of her he recalled the girl’s beautiful face and figure, and a vague fear ran through him as he reflected that it was just possible the conversation of which he had had so vivid a recollection, referred in some way to her.

•I wonder if I should have been justified in giving her some hint?” he said to himself, as he paced his room. " But, there, perhaps it would not have done. It is just possible I might have been deceived, and in that case I should have frightened her unnecessarily. Lampion might have been talking to the other man on some every-day business topic, and what I thought referred to her was capable of the simplest explanation. The next time I hear of her she will probably be in England, as safe and sound as when I saw her last If she should not, then all I can say is, her uncle had better look out for himself. What a pity it was I did not catch a glimpse of his companion. However, I shall know his voice again, if ever I hear it”
When all was ready he blew out his candle and crawled in beneath the mosquito curtains to compose himself for the night. He must have fallen asleep almost immediately, for he had no remembrance of anything else until he found himself sitting upright in bed with a man bending over him. The latter held in his hand a long, thin-bladed knife, with which he made a vicious stab, which fortunately missed its mark, at the man beneath him. To leap up and seize the fellow was the work of a moment. With one hand upon his throat, and the other clutching the wrist of the hand that held the knife, they left the bed and staggered out into the centre of the room together. The intruder, whoever he was, was a tall, muscular man, but fortunately for Dudley he also was big, and, what was more, he was possessed of 53

more than his fair share of strength. It was a question of skill against skill, of muscle against muscle. For the reason that both were barefooted their struggle produced little or no sound, and it was not until they came into contact with a table and brought it, with its contents, crashing to the ground, that the household received any intimation of the conflict going on so close to them. It was fortunate for Dudley, when they rolled over on to the floor, that he fell uppermost, for had he been underneath nothing could have saved him. As it was, he seated himself astride of his prostrate foe, pinioning his arms to his side as he did so. He had scarcely achieved his purpose before the door opened, and the Consul, carrying a candle in his hand, entered the room.
“ My dear fellow,” he cried in some alarm, as he saw the couple upon the floor, “ what on earth is the matter ? ”
“It looks very much as if some one has been attempting to murder me,” Dudley replied in gasps, for the struggle, short though it had been, had still been a fairly sharp one. “If you wouldn’t mind sending a couple of your men along to give me a hand, we will make sure of our friend here while we’ve got him. He’s as slippery as an eel”
The Consul hastened into the passage and called some of his servants who were waiting outside. When they entered the room they seized the vanquished ruffian and lifted him to his feet More lights were forthcoming, and with their assistance the intruder

was examined. Of one thing there could be no doubt: he was an Arab, and not a pleasant one at that
“ Now, Dudley,” said the Consul, when the malefactor had been secured, “tell me all that has happened ? ”
“ There is not very much to tell ” Dudley replied. “I woke ten minutes or so ago to find this rascal standing over me with a knife in his hand. Before he could do me any harm, however, I was out of bed and had got hold of him. We fell across that table and made the racket that brought you in.”
“Thank God you were not killed. You have had a terribly narrow escape.”
“ It looks like it, doesn’t it ? Perhaps you wouldn’t mind questioning our friend and finding out what he has to say for himself?”
“ Who are you and what brings you here ? ” asked Mr. Spurfield in Arabic.
The other, however, offered no reply, nor was it possible to elicit an answer from him with the help of any other dialect He merely shook his head to intimate that he did not understand, and the crossexamination could go no further.
“ There seems to be small doubt that his motive was robbery,” the Consul said, when he had made up his mind that the other did not intend to be communicative. “ How does it strike you ? ”
“ I don’t know quite what to think,” Dudley replied. “ If his motive were robbery, as you say, why did he not make his choice of my possessions and clear out

without waking me ? So far as I can see nothing is missing! ”
“It is altogether extraordinary,” Mr. Spurfield answered. “It is the first case of the kind I have known since I have been in this house. Well, I shall hand the man over to the authorities at once, and go into the case more thoroughly to-morrow. I cannot tell you how sorry I am that you should have been disturbed in this fashion. As your host, I feel as if I were in some measure to blame.”
“You must not say that,” said Dudley. “lam thankful he entered my room instead of yours ! He would have frightened Mrs. Spurfield horribly. Please don’t worry about me; I haven’t received a scratch. Good night”
“ Good night,” answered the Consul, as soon as the prisoner had been led away. “ Under the circumstances I am afraid it would be absurd to wish you pleasant dreams. I can say, however, that I hope you will not be disturbed again.”
“ I am not afraid of that,” said his guest “ Good night.”
Dudley’s nerves must have been in excellent order, for in spite of the struggle from which he had so recently emerged, and the narrowness with which he had escaped death, he had not been lying many minutes upon his bed before he was fast asleep. Perhaps, all things considered, it would have been better for him had he remained awake, for he had scarcely closed his eyes before he embarked upon a succession of bad dreams. As a rule he

slept as only men do who are the possessors of perfect health and quiet consciences. On this occasion, however, he was not so fortunate. Perhaps as a reflection of his recent achievement, he found himself engaged upon a series of deadly hand to hand encounters with no less a person than the redoubtable Achmet ben Hassein himself. They fought on the deck of the dhow, with his own Admiral alongside to see fair play; in the steam launch of the flag-ship, with half a dozen Kroo boys dodging round them, armed with coal hammers and fire rakes, ready to strike on the first convenient opportunity; and when these amusements palled, they continued to struggle in the fair way of the Mozambique Channel with none but the sharks at hand to enjoy the fun. The combats were somewhat one-sided for the reason that, while his adversary was armed with a long knife, Dudley had nothing with which to defend himself save a lady’s fan. He remembered that fan quite distinctly, for Miss Erskine had carried it on the night of the ball at Government House, and it had her monogram in gold upon the handle. Suddenly, so it seemed to him, the Arab made <a rush, closed with him, and having seized him by the throat, drew his arm back preparatory to plunging his knife in behind the shoulder-blade. Then with a start Dudley woke.
It was some time before he fell asleep again, but when he did he was in even worse case than before. This time he was himself and yet not himself, a composite being, perfectly simple in 57

construction at first glance, yet complex to the borders of insanity when he endeavoured to come to a proper understanding of him. A ship’s boat was floating on the surface of the deep; no land was in sight, nor could any sign of a vessel be observed from horizon to horizon. At first the boat did not appear to contain an occupant, and only Dudley, of all the inhabitants of the globe, was at hand to watch her drift Moved by a curiosity he could not explain, he drew nearer and looked into her. Not altogether to his surprise he found that she contained the dead body of a man. From his attitude he had probably been sitting on the sternmost of the thwarts when his death agony took possession of him. Then he must have fallen forward, for he now lay curled up upon the bottom. With a pity in his heart that was almost like a touch of physical pain, he turned the body over and looked upon the face. Then with a cry he awoke. The face of the dead man was none other than his own! He was the man in the drifting boat; it was over his dead body that the gulls wheeled and screamed. The perspiration of a fear such as he had never known before coursed down his cheeks. As he clapped his hands to his eyes to shut out the remembrance of that dreadful sight, he sat up and thanked God most fervently that it was daylight. Had darkness still prevailed, his brain must have turned. In vain he tried to throw off the feeling it had aroused in him; he had received a fright that had shaken him to the centre of his being. A cold bath, however, acted as a restorative,

and when, later on, Mr. Spurfield came to inquire whether he felt any ill effects from his adventure, he had almost recovered his equilibrium.
“ I have been thinking over that affair,” said the Consul, when they were seated in his office an hour or so later, “and I must confess I do not understand it Had you wakened to find the fellow appropriating your belongings, and had closed with him to prevent his escaping, I could have understood his action ; but for the man to have taken nothing and yet to have gone out of his way to attempt your life when you were not even aware of his presence, passes my comprehension. However, we shall see what the authorities have to say on the subject They may know something of the rascal’s antecedents.”
“ My only regret is that it should have happened at all,” said Dudley, lugubriously. “As things are now, it is imperative that I should not attract attention. It is just possible that this fuss may bring about complications that may serve to put Achmet ben Hassein upon his guard, and in that case it is probable we shall lose him for good and all”
“Possible, but not very probable^” returned his companion. “At any rate, we must hope for the best”
An hour later, the Consul, accompanied by Dudley, made his way to the Governor’s Palace, where the former had been informed that the circumstances connected with the outrage would be thoroughly investigated. Dudley was introduced to 59

his Excellency as a friend and guest of the Consul, whereupon the Governor offered his condolences and apologies for the unpleasantness to which he had been subjected.
* I pledge you my honour, sefior, that the villain shall be most thoroughly punished,” said the little man, rubbing his hands together and bowing between every word. “Domingo, have my commands been obeyed ? ”
An officer standing by informed him that everything had been done that was ordered.
“Then bring the prisoner before me. In the mean time, sefiors, permit me to offer you coffee and tobacco.”
By the time the excellent cigar the Governor had given him was fairly alight, the prisoner had been brought into the room, and Dudley was able to renew his acquaintance with his opponent of the previous night The interval had not been sufficiently long to detract from his sinister appearance; if possible it had added to it He proved to be, as has already been remarked, a stalwart ruffian with a treacherous, hang-dog face, and was plainly of Arab descent On being interrogated by the Governor as to his reasons for entering the house, he adopted his former tactics and declined to answer. Nothing would induce him to speak. Throughout the crossexamination he maintained a sullen silence that eventually roused the Portuguese Governor to a pitch of ungovernable fury.
“ He shall tell us his motive and the names of his 60

accomplices, or I will cut his liver out! ” cried the little man, his moustaches stiffening with rage.
He might, however, have spared himself the trouble of talking, for neither threat nor persuasion could induce the prisoner to confess. He simply watched his interrogators with sullen eyes, and declined to say anything whatsoever.
“Take him away!” cried the Governor at last. “ If he will not speak he shall be flogged until he does. That will bring the words out of him like a running river, or I am much deceived. In the name of his Majesty the King I tender you my sincere apologies, Seftor Spurfield, and I give you my word, senor” (turning to Dudley), “the word of the Governor, that whatever the rascal’s reason may have been for the outrage, it shall not go unpunished.”
His visitors thanked him for his courtesy, and, having once more accepted the assurance of his unbounded esteem, withdrew and returned to the British Consulate.
During the afternoon Dudley was engaged upon his correspondence in his own apartment, when Mr. Spurfield hurriedly presented himself before him. Feeling sure that something out of the common must have occurred to induce a man, usually so self-contained, to forget himself in this fashion, he inquired what had happened.
“ Something of a most exasperating nature,” the Consul replied, seating himself in a chair beside the table. “ I have just received an intimation from the Authorities, that while your assailant was being

escorted back to prison this morning, he managed to effect his escape. I have been assured that the Governor is furious, but-----”
“ I think I understand,” said Dudley. “ He is undone, his honour has been sullied, he will court-martial the officer of the guard, he will hang, draw, and quarter the prisoner when he catches him—but the question for our consideration is, will he try to catch him ? One thing is quite certain ; the fact that the fellow has escaped doesn’t clear up the mystery surrounding the case, does it ? ”
“ It only deepens it,” Spurfield answered. “ As I said this morning, there is more behind this business than meets the eye. However, I have sent a vigorous protest to the Governor, and we shall see what comes of it It strikes me as a pity now that we did not detain the prisoner until Samweli had taken stock of him. Possibly he might have been able to throw a little light upon the subject.”
“ I wonder when we shall see Samweli again ? ” Dudley replied. * Time presses, and whatever else happens we must not permit Achmet ben Hassein to give us the slip.”
“You need have no fear on that score,” said Spurfield. “ Samweli will take good care he doesn’t do that.”
That evening they were sitting upon the housetop, smoking and talking affectionately, as so many hundred exiles do, of England and her many joys, when a voice hailed them from the street below. They looked over the parapet to discover a villainous

native hawker offering his wares. The Consul shook his head ; he wanted nothing. Dudley was about to follow his example, when something in the hawker’s manner attracted his attention.
“ Tell him to bring his things up and we’ll buy all he has,” he whispered to the Consul. “ Can't you see it is Samweli ? ”

CHAPTER IV
Ever since the moment when Dudley saw Samweli standing in the street before the Consul’s house, he had been wondering what it was that made him recognize, in the bit of misfortune below him, the man for whom they were so anxiously waiting. He resembled a mad Indian fakir more than the stalwart Swahili who had waited upon them the previous evening. Such garments as he wore were in tatters, while the assortment of wares he carried on the tray slung before him were such as would have insulted the intelligence of the most irresponsible purchaser. However, Dudley was convinced that it w^r Samweli; and this being so, Mr. Spurfield gave the order that he should be admitted to the house and brought before him.
“ Well, Samweli,” said the Consul, after the other had revealed his identity, and had been welcomed with a heartiness that almost bordered on enthusiasm, “since you have come back to us so soon, I hope it means that you have been able to secure some information.”
“ It is even as you say,” Samweli answered. “ I 64

have seen Achmet ben Hassein, that dog without teeth, and have learned his plans.”
“And where is his dhow anchored?” inquired Spurfield.
“In the bay that is called Mazazima,” Samweli replied.
“ But is not that a long way from Mozambique ? ” asked Dudley, watching the other’s face as he put the question. “What is the meaning of this, Samweli ? Why is he sailing from Mazazima instead of from this port ? Has he been warned that I am on the watch for him ? ”
“It is because he fears to come to Muhibidi (Mozambique), lest the English sailor should hear of it and seize him.”
Both Spurfield and Dudley looked at each other with real surprise. If what Samweli had said were correct, the wind was indeed taken out of their sails.
“Do you mean to say,” cried Dudley, “that he knows what I am going to do ? ”
Samweli shook his head. “No,” he answered. “All he knows is that the Englishman has left his ship, and now is in Muhibidi.”
“ But how on earth did he become aware of my presence here?” asked Dudley.
“ That I do not know,” returned Samweli, simply; “but it is certain that he does know it.” Then he added more cheerfully, “ He is the son of a dog, and by the grace of the Prophet, whose name be ever blessed, we will cut his throat ere he be many days

older. Since he has heard my news, has the Englishman still a desire to sail in the dhow ? ”
“ It is more than ever my wish,” Dudley replied. “But now that he knows of my presence here, and has decided to sail from Mazazima, how is it to be managed ? ”
“ I have thought of that while I have been coming,” said Samweli, “and have good news to tell thee. Because Achmet ben Hassein is a fool, and the son of a fool, he thinks no one is so clever as himself. But he will learn wisdom before he is much older. When he sets sail in the dhow, he will take with him ten men, of whom I, Samweli, will be one.”
The giant rubbed his hands together, and beamed with satisfaction. This was a joke he could appreciate.
“Yes, I go, even I,” he went on, licking his lips. “ There comes a time when the tooth of vengeance shall bite on the flesh of hate. But it must be done carefully, or he will suspect, and then our work will be in vain.”
“That is all very well,” answered Dudley. “But you have not told me what I am to do, and how I am to do it.”
“Peace, and I will tell thee everything,” Samweli replied. “Be it known to thee that Achmet ben Hassein is one who is afraid of his, what the Wazungu (White men) call luck.”
“ Samweli desires to infer that the Arab is superstitious,” interpreted the Consul. “Go on. We understand.”

"For this reason he has prayed to the blessed Prophet to permit him a sign that he will succeed in that which he is about to attempt Now, there is but one thing which would bring him good fortune. It is believed by the Arabs that men who have not their right senses are blessed by Allah. This Achmet ben Hassein thinks to be true.”
" I think I understand,” said Dudley, with a smile, turning to Spurfield. "I have often heard it said that the Arabs have a notion that if a lunatic or idiot happens to put in an appearance, just as they are about to embark on some enterprise, he is certain to bring them good fortune. I suppose Samweli has been driving this idea into his head.” Then, turning to the Swahili, who had been listening to their conversation with curious eyes, he continued, “You have spoken to Achmet ben Hassein about this, is that not so ? ”
Samweli did not deny the soft impeachment. " It was for our good,” he answered. "Why should I not speak to him ? ”
"There is no reason at all. If you had tried for a year you could not have hit upon a better plan,” Dudley replied. "You are a genius, Samweli, and I salute you as such. Now, I suppose there is only one inference to be drawn from your remarks, and that is that I am to act the part of a lunatic ? I’ll be hanged, however, if I see how I am to do it. Perhaps you can enlighten me, Spurfield ? ”
"You had better ask Samweli,” the Consul returned. " He knows more about it than I do.”

Dudley put the question to the gigantic negro.
“ It will be very easy,” the latter answered with a chuckle. “ Give heed, and I will show thee. It is necessary that the white man should speak Arabic ?”
He looked anxiously at Dudley. So much depended upon the other’s answer to his question.
“ Not so well as Achmet does, of course,” Dudley returned, “but well enough to act the part of a lunatic, I fancy. How will this sort of thing do ? ”
As he said this he seated himself on the floor and began to rock himself backwards and forwards, intoning verses from the Koran, and sonorously calling upon the name of Allah.
It was an excellent piece of acting, and it impressed the two men, as he had hoped it would do.
“You will pass muster beautifully, if you can only keep it up,” began Spurfield, when he had finished. “I had no idea you were such an actor. Where did you learn it ? ”
“ In Cairo,” Dudley replied. * I used to visit the Howling Dervishes, and take notes. What do you think of it, Samweli ? ”
Samweli was good enough to express his approval.
“ Now there remains but the dress and the skin,” he said.
“ The skin 1 ” cried Dudley. “ What do you mean by that ? ”
“The Wazungu’s skin is too fair,” the Swahili answered. “He could not board the dhow as he is. He must stain his skin and dress like an Arab.”

“That is a cheerful look out,” rejoined Dudley. “I wonder what my friends in Cape Town would say if they could see me in the guise of a mad Arab ? How little the Admiral contemplated, when he first spoke to me of this business in the ball-room at Government House, the sort of figure I should be compelled to cut in order to bring it to a successful issue! ” Then, turning to Samweli, he continued, “ How are you going to procure me the disguise and the dye ? ”
“Even now they are here,” said the other. “I have brought them with me to-night”
So saying, he produced from his basket a bundle of rags and a small bottle containing a dark mixture. These he placed at Dudley’s feet. From the satisfaction upon his face it was evident that, in his own mind, he was playing the game in the most approved fashion.
“So much for the disguise,” Dudley answered. “ Now for the other arrangements. To begin with, how am I to reach the harbour where the dhow is lying? And how am I to get on board the vessel herself without attracting attention ? ”
“There is but one way,” said Samweli. “The Wazungu must cross the strait, and make his way along the coast to the bay. When he gets there, he must swim off to the dhow at the last moment, and so come aboard. I will take care that Achmet ben Hassein shall believe that good fortune will not sail with him unless an answer be given to his prayer. When he finds thee aboard he will be a happy man.”

“And at what hour will the dhow sail?” inquired Mr. Spurfield, who had been listening attentively to the arrangements. “My friend must know that before he leaves here.”
“She will sail with the wind that blows off the land at daybreak,” Samweli answered.
“Very good: I will be there,” Dudley replied. “ Now, one other question before you go. How are you armed? When Achmet has got his goods on board the dhow our turn will come. Can you use a revolver ? ”
Here the Consul interposed. “ I happen to know that Samweli is an excellent marksman,” he retorted. “You will be quite justified in entrusting him with a weapon.”
“ In that case I had better give him one at once,” Dudley answered. “ I shall not see him again until we meet on board the dhow.”
With that he retired to his room below, to return presently with a revolver and a supply of ammunition.
“ Take this with you,” he said. “ Hide it carefully, so that Ben Hassein shall not know that you are armed. Between us, when an opportunity arrives, we should be able to render a very fair account of ourselves.”
“ I sincerely trust you may,” responded Spurfield. “ I shall not know any peace until I have received a message from you, telling me that you are safe in Zanzibar. Be faithful, Samweli, and your fortune is made. If you are not, beware; for nothing can save you. You remember what befell M’bwena ?”

“ I remember,” Samweli answered. “ But the white man need have no fear. It is because I am at enmity with Achmet ben Hassein, that I am embarking on this enterprise. He slew my brother; I shall slay him. Fear not; I shall be faithful. And when your friend returns to Muhibidi, he will render a good account of me.”
“ That is well spoken,” said the Consul, “ and I believe it to be true talk.”
When Samweli had taken his departure, the Consul and Dudley remained smoking upon the housetop for upwards of an hour, discussing the various items of the programme.
“ Tell me candidly,” Spurfield began at last, “ now that you have had all the arrangements explained to you, and have been given an opportunity of seeing what risks it will entail, are you still as keen on going as you were ? ”
“ Of course I am,” Dudley answered, with a laugh. * What did you expect ? It seems to me I am in for rather a good thing. I never thought private theatricals would stand me in such good stead.”
“Take care that they don’t prove too much for you,” remarked Spurfield. “Remember that you are not playing in a back drawing-room to an audience of enthusiastic relatives, but are setting out to hoodwink a man who would think as little of sticking a knife into you as he would of wringing the neck of a jungle partridge.”
“Knowing, as I do, that my life depends upon my playing, it will only serve to make me act the

better,” replied Dudley. “ There is nothing to equal an appreciative house, believe me. And now, good night I think, if you will excuse me, I will turn in. It is just possible that I may not be able to obtain a good night’s rest for some little time to come.”

CHAPTER V
If I were to continue the simile with which I concluded the previous chapter, I might go on to say that the rage for amateur theatricals, which has taken possession of the latter portion of the nineteenth century, has, if it has done nothing else, at least taught us what is meant by that very significant term * stage fright” Those who have experienced it will be able to appreciate, in some small measure, therefore, Dudley’s feelings as he stood by the water’s edge in the Bay of Mazazima on the African coast, an hour before daylight, preparatory to embarking on his swim out to the dhow upon which he had engaged himself to play so important a part. His smart naval uniform was on board the flagship at Cape Town; the civilian attire, in which he had figured at Mozambique, was in his bag at the Consul’s house ; and now he stood upon the fore shore of the bay, with the wavelets lapping round his feet, a dyed, distorted, and disfigured abomination, such as no living soul could possibly have recognized as Navigating Lieutenant Dudley, R.N. A strange quiet seemed to brood over the world. Save the ripple of the water at his feet, not a sound was to be heard, and to the young 73

man himself it seemed as if he were standing on the threshold of a new world. To say that he was not nervous would be absurd ; the situation was one that would have been sufficiently hazardous to have shaken the nerves of the most fearless of human beings. For the first time since he had embarked upon it, a very real notion of the danger attending the enterprise forced itself upon him. He knew that there was still time to draw back if he desired to do so; and he was also aware that, when once he had set foot upon the dhow, that chance would be taken from him for ever. He thought of Miss Erskine, and, in spite of the gravity of his position, a smile flitted across his face as he compared his present appearance with that which he had presented when he had been introduced to her in the ball-room at Government House. He wondered what she would think of him, if she could only see him now.
“Well, I suppose there is nothing for it but to get aboard,” he said to himself, as he waded into deeper water. " Here goes to try my luck for good and all. It’s a good thing for me that this dye doesn’t come off, or I should be a washed-out remnant indeed when I get aboard.”
So saying, he lowered himself into the water and struck out for the dhow, which he could just see dimly outlined against the sky a couple of hundred yards or so from the bank. It was not a very long swim, but such as it was it was quite enough for the purpose at hand. The bay was famous for its sharks, and Dudley had no desire to make their acquaintance.

Achmet ben Hassein, he felt certain, would be quite dangerous enough.
Having come alongside the vessel, he seized the first thing available, and hauled himself on board. As it proved, it would have been an easy matter to have captured the dhow and her entire company, for no anchor watch was kept, and his arrival on board was quite unperceived. With the water dripping from his rags upon the deck, he stood looking about him for a place in which to hide himself until his presence on board the vessel should be discovered. Then making his way forward, he clambered from the well up to the foc’s’le head, and ensconced himself in the very nose of the vessel She was a rambling old concern, of possibly a hundred tons; she boasted a well amidships, out of which rose a couple of rakish masts and a high, ungainly poop. Of her crew Dudley could find no trace, though he searched the deck for them. He wondered whether Samweli was aware that he had come aboard, and if so, how he would comport himself towards him when they first met It would be an awkward moment for them both, and if they should allow the slightest sign to escape them that they had seen each other before, all would be lost
Slowly the night wore on, and from his place of vantage in the bows Dudley watched the dawn make its appearance in the sky. Even on one never-to-be-forgotten morning, when the first glimpse of the coming day was to be the signal for his vessel going into action, his first engagement, he had not watched 75

more anxiously for the rising of the sun. First, a weird, grey light along the sea-line, so faint that it was scarcely perceptible; then, and so very gradually that it was hardly apparent, a flush of palest salmon pink that little by little merged itself into the grey. Afterwards a tremulous dawn wind that just ruffled the surface of the deep and served to sweep the few remaining stars from the sky. Then, when the grey had disappeared, and the breeze had for the moment died down, the God of Morning came to paint the heavens with the thousand and one colours of his palette. Not to be outdone, the shore wind grew gradually stronger, until the clumsy old dhow began to bow and curtsey to it. Presently a sleepy voice on the lower deck called upon Salim, Ramachan, Kopa, and others to awake, for night was past and day was born. In answer to the summons, the crew made their appearance on the deck, and were almost immediately at prayer, their heads turned towards Mecca. While they were thus engaged, Dudley prepared himself for the surprise he proposed to give them. Choosing the moment when they were rising to their feet, he cried aloud upon the name of Allah, and, whirling his arms about his head, pirouetted towards the break of the foc’s’le. The wonderment of the men below may be better imagined than described. For a moment they stood looking at him as if bewitched. How had this lunatic come aboard? they asked themselves. What did his presence signify ? Then an old man, with a cunning, evil face, emerged from the seclusion of the poop, and 76

Dudley knew that, for the first time in his life, he stood face to face with the redoubtable slaver— Achmet ben Hassein. Once more he waved his arms about his head and executed a fas-seul upon the deck, shouting as he did so some verses from the Koran. At last, having reached the main-deck, he fell exhausted at the Arab leader’s feet It was a critical moment in the adventure, for he knew that if he betrayed himself in the least possible particular, his fate was decided, and nothing on earth could save him. Pulling himself together, he began to rock his body backwards and forwards, as he had done on the roof of the Consul’s house at Mozambique, intoning portions of the Koran, and promising the blessings of Allah upon such as would take pity upon the sorrows of the poor.
“ Whence comest thou?" inquired the Arab; “and how didst thou come on board this dhow ? ”
“Who maketh the wind to whistle in the long grass, and putteth words of wisdom in the mouth of the simple ? ” asked the madman, oracularly. “ Give me food, and fortune shall follow thee whithersoever thou goest.”
As he had not been discovered yet, Dudley began to breathe more freely. Samweli had spoken the truth. It was plain that Ben Hassein believed the madman’s presence to be a direct sign that Heaven intended his enterprise should be a successful one.
“ I will give thee food and shelter, and thou shalt bring me good fortune, as thou sayest,’’ said the other 77

at last “ But if thou failest me, I will cut thy throat from ear to ear.”
Without appearing to notice this threat, Dudley recommenced his slow rocking backwards and forwards, muttering to himself. In his own heart he rejoiced at the success his scheme had met with, but his common sense told him that he must not show his satisfaction until he was safely out of the wood. There was still time for some untoward event to upset all his calculations.
The breeze having freshened considerably by this time, Achmet gave orders that sail should be set upon the dhow. Accordingly, the great lateens were cast loose, the primitive anchor was lifted aboard, and, after much shouting and apparent confusion, the dhow began slowly to draw ahead, the land dropped astern, and the crazy old vessel headed for the open sea.
Hugging the southern shore, they passed out between the Capes Mocuo and Mblamo, and then steered an almost due northerly course, as if they were heading for Zanzibar. The wind was favourable, and slowly but steadily the dhow ploughed her way along, with a rippling of water under her fore foot that was as soothing as the softest music.
The better to carry out the part of the witless person he was supposed to represent, Dudley seated himself in the same place where he had interviewed Ben Hassein an hour before, rocking himself to and fro, and muttering continually. By the Arab’s orders food was brought to him, but he allowed it
78

to remain where it was placed, as if he had not noticed its presence. Once or twice, however, he permitted himself to look up, in the hope of attracting Samweli’s attention, but it was not until well after midday that he caught a glimpse of that secretive individual. Even then he did not attempt in any way to communicate with him. An opportunity would come sooner or later, he felt sure, and, situated as he was, he was not going to run the risk of speaking to him until he was sure it would entail no evil consequences. By sunset they had reached Pomba Bay, called by the natives Mwambi, and had anchored near the village of Nyamazezi on the southern side. When all was ready, Achmet ben Hassein went ashore, and did not return until a late hour. It was during his absence that Dudley was permitted the chance for which he had been so patiently waiting. He had scarcely made his way forward and seated himself in his old place in the bows, when a tall figure came up and stood beside him. One glance was sufficient to show that it was Samweli.
To ward off suspicion, he continued to recite his Koran for some minutes, without appearing to have observed the other’s presence. Then he stopped, and, without turning his head, asked the man standing before him, in an undertone, whether he thought that the Arab suspected his identity.
“ Rest content; he does not know,” Samweli replied. “ He thinks that thou art what thou pretendest to be. Indeed, his disguise is so good, that the Englishman almost deceived me.”

“ That is good hearing, indeed,” said Dudley. * And now tell me what his arrangements are ? When shall we sail again, and where are we to pick up the steamer ? ”
“We shall sail at dawn,” the other answered, “ and we shall meet the vessel we look for off Ras Baku to the north of the island of Comoro, at daybreak of the second day.”
“ That is to say, on the morning of the day after to-morrow,” Dudley retorted. “You still have your revolver ? *
“ It is quite safe,” Samweli returned. * I wait only for the time to use it And now I will go back, or they may think there is something amiss. Salaam I ”
“Salaam 1” said Dudley. “Be careful, and we may find a time to talk again.”
It was, perhaps, as well that Samweli did as he suggested; for within a few minutes Ben Hassein returned on board. Despite his faith, he had evidently been indulging in strong waters, for he reeled as he made his way along the deck.
Next morning at dawn the dhow was got under way once more, and as soon as Sid Ali Point with its heavy jungle reaching down to the water’s edge, was behind them, her head was pointed out to sea, or in other words, for Comoro Island. When Dudley came to consider the question, he was struck with the cleverness which had dictated the choice of these islands as a rendezvous. To define their position correctly, it may be observed that the Comoros,

four in number, lie almost midway between the northern extremity of the island of Madagascar and the African coast Though under the protection of the French Government, they are ruled by their own sultans, and are to all intents and purposes independent kingdoms. There is little traffic among them, though dhows plying from Zanzibar to the Mozambique coast in the south-west monsoon, are reported to touch there. Of larger craft the steamers of the Messageries Maritime Company call once a month, but only at one point, Mayotta, on the island of the same name. The headland of Ras Baku, the most northerly point of Conloro, the chief of the group, is of volcanic origin, concerning which but little is known. It lies off the beaten track, for vessels bound for South Africa hug the continent religiously, until they make Cape Delgado, whence they pass to the westward of the Lazarus Bank, and so go on their way down the coast to Mozambique.
That evening Achmet ben Hassein, as soon as he had eaten his meal, sent for Dudley. The latter was in his usual place forward, but on the message being brought to him, he rose and immediately hastened aft to comply with it
“I only hope and trust my Arabic may prove equal to the strain,” he said to himself. “ If it doesn’t, I shall be in a pretty fix. Why could he not have left the interview until to-morrow night ? Our positions might have been reversed then.”
Making his way to the poop, he discovered Ben Hassein reclining on his carpet He received him

with every sign of cordiality, and bade him seat himself beside him.
“The blessing of the Prophet be upon Achmet ben Hassein,” began the supposed lunatic, as soon as an opportunity presented itself. “May his sons be like strong lambs, and his daughters beautiful as the rivers that flow through the gates of Paradise. May his enemies fall before him, and those who-------”
“Peace, peace,” interrupted the other. “Tell me who thou art, and whence thou comest”
To this question, however, Dudley vouchsafed no reply. He had his assumed name, as well as the name of his father, ready upon the tip of his tongue, and he was also prepared with a description of his birthplace ; but, acting on a flash of inspiration, he decided not to utter them. It was just possible, he argued, that the man might chance to be a native of the same place, or, even if he were not, that he might be sufficiently well acquainted with it to be in a position to criticize his assertions. In that case detection would be certain. He decided, therefore, to persist in this role of lunatic, and, in answer to the other’s interrogations, offered only a vacant reply. Tired at last of questioning him, Ben Hassein bade him retire, and right gladly the other complied with the order. Feeling that he had come very well out of what promised to be an extremely awkward predicament, he made his way forward to his usual camping-place, and, once there, settled himself down for the night, furtively eating such scraps of food as he had been able to collect without being 82

seen. So far as the crew had observed, he had hitherto eaten nothing, and it was plain that this asceticism on his part had raised him to a high pitch in their estimation; only a holy man, they argued, would deprive himself of food when it was offered to him in such profusion. All that night and well into the next day the dhow sailed on. Indeed, it was nearly midday before they obtained their first glimpse of the island of Comoro. Then, keeping the land well away to starboard, they crawled along the coast, until the headland of Ras Baku came into sight Then, having brought the small township of Mpanuhli abeam, they anchored in thirty fathoms of water, and once more Ben Hassein went ashore. He had not been gone more than an hour before Samweli was permitted an opportunity of conversing with Dudley. He hastened to avail himself of it
“To-morrow morning at daybreak the steamer will be in sight,” said the Englishman, by way of introduction. “We will then permit them to tranship their goods, and allow the steamer to get well out of sight before we attempt to take possession of the dhow. At the moment when they are eating their midday meal will be the best time, for they will not suspect any treachery then. Yqu will be sitting with them, but at a signal from me you will spring to your feet, and, producing your revolver, will call upon them to put their hands up, promising to shoot the man who disobeys. In the mean time I will make Ben Hassein safe. Do you understand ?”
Samweli replied in the affirmative, and then, 83

\ after they had arranged various other details, they separated. When he was alone, Dudley sat in his corner, looking up at the blazing stars overhead, and wondering what the morrow would bring forth. So far he had succeeded beyond his wildest expectations; but would his luck carry him through to the end ? This was a question that only time could answer.
Next morning the crew of the dhow were up and about long before the sun showed any signs of rising. There was a look of expectation upon every man’s face, and it seemed to Dudley that Ben Hassein’s evil countenance was even more truculent than usual.
“ He little dreams what is in store for him,” said the young man, as he seated himself and folded his arms in order to make sure that his revolver was ready to hand in case it should be needed. * It will come to him as a bit of a surprise, I expect.”
As soon as the first meal of the day had been cooked and eaten, the dhow got under way. It was a perfect morning, the air was soft and balmy, and the sea as smooth as a sheet of glass. A better day for the work in hand could scarcely have been imagined. The great sails filled and the wind sighed pleasantly among the cordage. Suddenly Dudley heard a shout, a cry of warning, then the sounds of blows and a heavy fall. Anticipating some treachery, he was about to spring to his feet, when he received a violent blow upon the back of his head, and fell forward, senseless, upon the deck.

CHAPTER VI
When Dudley recovered from the state of insensibility in which he had been thrown by the vicious blow upon his head, as described in the previous chapter, his whole body seemed one excruciating pain. He tried to move, only to find that every efiort was in vain, his arms and legs were pinioned, and he could not stir an inch. It was well-nigh midday, the heat was intolerable, and, to add to his torture, the sun beat down full and fair upon his face. The more conscious he became of his surroundings, the greater were his sufferings. His tongue had swollen, and his skin was so parched that it felt as if it were being strained to breaking pitch. Once more he tried to raise his head, but, as before, the attempt was useless. He tried to think, but his head swam, and it was with difficulty he could collect his thoughts. The situation was painfully apparent; he was in a native boat, and adrift upon the open sea. But how had he got there? and was Achmet ben Hassein the instigator of this fiendish cruelty ? Then, in a flash, it occurred to him that he had passed through all this before, and in a dream. He remembered how, in the Consul’s house at Mozambique, on 85
Digitized by GOOQle
A Sailor’s Bride
the night that the attempt had been made upon his life, he had dreamed that he saw himself lying dead in an open boat, drifting upon the open sea.
"O my God,” he cried in an agony of fear, as the recollection of that terrible picture came to him, “ be merciful and kill me at once I Spare me further torture.”
The sound of his voice had scarcely died away before a low moan came from the bows of the boat, and a voice that he scarcely recognized cried piteously for water.
“ Is that you, Samweli ? ” he asked, speaking with difficulty.
A heavy moan was the only answer he received ; Samweli was too far gone by this time for speech. Another silence followed, during which Dudley endeavoured to remember what had happened on board the dhow. One thing was self-evident, the Arab had been fooling them all the time. By some means, he had become aware of the attempt that was to be made to take him prisoner, and, with his natural cunning, he had foreseen that it would be a safer course for him to take his enemies with him on the voyage to the steamer, and thus have them at hand, to be made secure at his leisure, rather than to allow them to remain behind, and perhaps cut him off before he could reach the land. But, if this were so, and he had made up his mind to kill them, why had he not done so outright, instead of playing with them in this fiendish fashion? Hell itself could have produced no greater torture. He closed his 86

eyes, but the burning sun shone through the lids, until it seemed as though the very eyeballs were scorching in the heat The ropes that bound his wrists and ankles ate into his flesh, and stopped the circulation of his blood; his head swam, his eyes became glassy; surely this suffering could not endure much longer. At last a merciful delirium took possession of him, and for a time his soul knew peace. He fancied himself in England once more, back in the forest he loved so well. How delightful was the shade of the grand old trees I how cool and tempting the water of the brooks! Then that beautiful picture faded away, and he awoke to his former agony, to find the boat drifting on and on, and the sea-bird wheeling above it, screaming upon the death they dared not hasten. Samweli’s piteous entreaties for water had ceased long since.
Then a wonderful thing happened, something so extraordinary that to chronicle it would seem like courting ridicule. While Dudley lay gazing up at the pitiless sky above him, a shadow fell upon the boat, and a moment later two great sails set on a rakish mast made their appearance between it and the sun. Then the dhow, the same from which they had been so mercilessly expelled that morning, sailed slowly by, so close indeed, that the ripple of the water at her bows could be distinctly heard, and even the faces of the crew, as they gathered at the bulwarks to watch the effect of their handiwork, could be distinguished. She had succeeded in her enterprise, and was now making her way back to the African
87

coast with her contraband cargo. Dudley looked up at her as she passed. He could see Achmet ben Hassein, rifle in hand, standing on the raised poop, watching him. A moment later a bullet struck the boat and tore off a splinter within a few inches of Dudley’s head. Was it possible that, at the last moment, a touch of pity had stirred the Arab’s heart, and that in firing the shot he was endeavouring to cut short the agony he had himself inflicted ? or was it his intention merely to frighten or to wound, and thus to add another touch to his first malicious cruelty ? In either case the result was the same, for slowly the shadow of the dhow passed away, leaving them, as before, to silence and despair.
Sometime later Dudley called to Samweli; but as no answer came, he decided in his own mind that the gigantic negro was dead. The sun sank lower and lower, and at last disappeared altogether in a wealth of gorgeous colouring. How different their position was now from what it had been when he had made his appearance that morning I Then they had looked forward with almost a feeling of certainty to the successful issue of their plan; now it had failed, and death was their reward. As the sun disappeared, a cool breeze sprang up, and played upon Dudley’s face with a softness that was almost caressing. Desperate though his position was, it revived new hopes in him. Only half conscious of what was happening, he watched the day die out, and night descend, till one by one the stars appeared and looked down upon him as if in pity. When the 88

A Sailor’s Bride
moon rose and sailed like a ball of gold into the sky, the sea rose also, until the boat was tossed like a frail shuttle-cock upon the waters. More than once she stood in imminent danger of capsizing, but Providence stood by her, and, though the waves broke over her repeatedly, she took no hurt. To Dudley it seemed as if strange shapes were following her, peering at him and mocking him in his misery. They were the ghosts of men and women he had known long since in other parts of the world. He called to them, but they did not answer, only smiled and pointed at him, as if in derision. Then they passed on as a woman came floating through the moonlight towards the boat, and, leaning on the gunwale, stooped to look at him. There could be no mistaking that sweet and gentle face—it was his mother’s. As he raised his head and looked up at her, the love he had ever felt for her came back to him, and when she placed her hand upon his forehead and breathed his name, his pain departed, and he sank back dying, so he thought
When he opened his eyes again, a great and wonderful change had come over his position. To his amazement, he was no longer lying pinioned in the boat, but was stretched out on a heap of coarse canvas on the fore hatch of a fair-sized steamer. He could scarcely believe that it was not a return of his delirium, a creation of his overwrought fancy, that would presently fade away. He could see the crew moving about the deck; a group of firemen off duty clustered at the entrance to their quarters in the

foc’s’le. Then when he heard the mate’s voice give an order from the bridge above, he came to the conclusion that it was not a dream after all, but a God-sent reality. At the same moment, one of the men standing near him, seeing that he was awake, shouted something in the direction of the galley. In response, a stout man, with a white cap on his head and wearing an apron, put in an appearance, carrying in his hand a bowl of broth, which he stirred with a spoon.
“Ha, ha! my poor benighted heathen,” he said as he approached the hatch, “ so you’ve managed to bring up alongside your senses again, have you? Well now, what you’ve got to do is to put yourself outside this broth before you’re much older. Can’t move? Up with your head, then, and open your mouth, and I’ll feed you with the spoon like a blessed baby! ”
Dudley tried to raise himself to a sitting posture, but could not manage it He had therefore to be content with opening his mouth and allowing the other to pour some spoonfuls of the fluid into it It was poor-enough stuff; but such as it was it put new life into him. When he had swallowed a little he closed his eyes once more. He had not even strength enough to ask the name of the vessel that had rescued him, or to inquire under what circumstances the rescue had taken place. A few minutes later he was in a dreamless sleep.
When next he opened his eyes it must have been midday, for the crew were seated upon the deck near him at their dinner. His sleep had done him a world of good, and he felt like a new man. On

learning that he was again awake, his friend, the cook, once more put in an appearance, and gave him food.
“ You’re not going to peg out this voyage, after all,” he began, with his customary cheerfulness, when his patient had swallowed the last spoonful of the broth. M But you may take my word for it, you looked precious like it when we picked you up. When you’re on your legs again, you’ll have to spin your yarn, and tell us how you came to be adrift tied up like that I suppose you can speak English if you want to ? ”
Until that moment Dudley had forgotten that he was still to all appearances an Arab. He was about to explain his nationality when he saw the man, who had up to that moment been seated beside him, rise and touch his cap. He was wondering what could have occasioned this exhibition of politeness, when another man appeared from the alley way behind them, and approached the hatch upon which he was lying. It was a fortunate circumstance for Dudley that he had time to look at him before the other reached his side, otherwise it would have been extremely unlikely that he could have got his features under control in time. Indeed, the shock, as it was, proved well-nigh too much for him. The whole thing seemed scarcely believable; for there, walking towards him, looking just the same as when he had last seen him in Cape Town, was no less a person than Doctor Lampion, Miss Erskine’s uncle. He was dressed entirely in white, had a large cigar between his lips, and a broad-brimmed hat upon his
9i

head. He strolled leisurely along the deck, and when he reached the hatch-side blew a cloud of smoke as he looked down upon the man stretched upon it It was plain that, however ill the sick Arab might be,'nothing was further from his thoughts than to offer any professional assistance.
“Well, cook, how does the beggar seem now?” he inquired casually, taking his cigar out of his mouth.
“ I fancy he’s on the mend, sir,” the cook replied. “ But it must have been a touch and go case with him, any way. I never thought we should have pulled him round.”
* Much better to have left him in the boat to die,” the other answered contemptuously. “ It would have saved a lot of trouble. The officer of the watch would have done so, had it not been for my niece’s supplications. It was she who first sighted the boat, and implored the skipper to see whether there was any one in it”
At this news Dudley’s heart gave a great leap in his breast, and then almost as suddenly seemed to stand stilt Could it be possible that Miss Erskine was on board the vessel? He could scarcely believe it It seemed so wildly improbable; and yet if she were not, to whom did her uncle refer ?
In order that the doctor should not recognize him, Dudley turned his face away.
“Sulky brute!” said Lampion. “He has the manners of a pig. Do what you will for an Arab, he is never grateful; the more you consider him, the

less he’ll think of you. The stick is the only thing that appeals to their intelligence.”
He was about to walk aft when a laughing voice hailed him from the bridge above.
“ How’s your patient this afternoon, doctor? ” the speaker inquired. " Doing you credit, I hope.”
Dudley gave another start Where had he met the owner of that voice ? It was as familiar to him as his own, yet for the moment he could not recall where he had heard it Then he remembered. It was the voice of the man he had overheard talking to Doctor Lampion in the room at the hotel in Cape Town, just before he left for Mozambique. Yes, he was quite certain of it There could be no mistake about it In that case what did the doctor’s presence upon this vessel betoken ?
He was still puzzling his brain to find an explanation for it, after Lampion had left him, when he chanced to look up^at the hurricane deck above him. The afternoon was full of surprises, for there, standing by the rails, was no less a person than Miss Erskine herself. But, oh! how ill she looked 1 Her beautiful face was worn almost to a shadow ; her complexion was deathly white, and from it her large dark eyes looked out upon the world with an almost ghostly effect. Why was she there ? and why did she look so ill ?—she who only a few weeks before had been the embodiment of health. Was it ?-—here he paused for a moment, the thought seemed too terrible for him to dwell upon. But the position had to be faced. Was it possible that her presence on board the 93

A Sailor’s Bride
steamer was the outcome of the conversation he had overheard in the hotel at thelDocks ? Was it to this that Lampion’s mysterious friend had referred when he had said, * If you must have the money, do as I propose; but remember, my price is fifty thousand pounds. I will not run the risk for a penny less ” ? If the dark suspicion that he had in his mind were in any way correct, what a pair of fiends these men must be I One thing was very certain, at any hazard he must set his doubts at rest. And if it were as he could not help fearing, then Miss Erskine must be saved. But how could he do it? He knew nothing of their plans, and he had only his own ghastly suspicions upon which to work. If ever a man found himself placed in a terrible position, he was that one. Of one thing he was quite determined, as things were now, he was not going to discard his disguise. To do that he must reveal his identity, and thus set Lampion upon his guard.
“Good God!” he muttered to himself, “if my suspicions are correct, then Lampion must be the vilest hound that walks this earth! But surely it cannot be true. I must be deceiving myself. And yet, if it is not, what did those two men mean ; and why is Miss Erskine upon this boat, looking so different from her former self ? ”
The question was easier asked than answered. Suspicions once aroused are proverbially hard to allay. He turned the question over and over in his mind, looked at it from every standpoint and in every light, endeavouring, as far as lay in his power, to

arrive at some logical solution of it But his efforts were in vain. There was Miss Erskine’s pale face continually rising in evidence before him. When she had left the deck and gone aft, the memory of her sad, dark eyes haunted him for hours afterwards.
“Something must be done—something must be done,” he repeated. “Her life is in my hands. What am I to do ? I can’t go to Lampion and tax him with his treachery, and I can’t stand by and let him kill her. I must find some way of outwitting them.”
Half an hour later, when Dudley’s obliging friend the cook put in an appearance with another bowl of soup, he found his patient so far recovered as to be able to sit up.
“You’ve turned the corner now,” he said. “Eat enough, and you’ll do, I’m thinking. What do you say ? ”
Dudley grunted a reply in Arabic, but the other only shook his head.
“ No^ savee,” he replied. “ Haven’t you a few words of good honest English about you, old man ? ” Dudley saw that, in view of certain contingencies arising, it would be as well that he should own to some small knowledge of English, so he replied to the effect that he could speak a few words of the White Man’s tongue.
“Then why didn’t you say so at once, and be done with it? ” said the cook, wrathfully. “ Now, just tell me how it was that you came to be aboard that

boat, tied up in such a cut-throat fashion? The whole ship’s company wants to know."
Dudley had been expecting this question, and was consequently prepared with his narrative. In broken English, eked out with Arabic, he told the story of a certain dhow’s voyage from Zanzibar to Pomba Bay. He had the misfortune to be the nephew of the owner, he declared, and his uncle had always hated him because he was rich and would not give him money when he wanted it They had not been many days at sea before they quarrelled, and at last, having rendered him. unconscious, his uncle had sent him adrift in an open boat with one slave, both of them tied up as the men had seen.
“ I never took much stock in uncles myself,” the cook replied, when he had finished. “ They ain’t the real thing any way you look at them. I used to live with one before I went to sea—a butcher he was, down Shadwell v/ay. He used to knock me about with a strap when he had nothing else to do, which was most always, so I took my oath I’d bolt for sea just as soon as I got the chance. He was a beauty; but I don’t mind telling you that this uncle of yours beats him out and back again. When you clap eyes on him next time, take my tip, and speak to him pretty brisk-like. Have it out, and settle it once for all. It’s not a bit of good unless you do.”
Dudley shook his head, to indicate that he did not quite understand, and then, feeling tired, laid himself down again upon the hatch. As he did so, a feeling of remorse came over him; he remembered that, in 96

his anxiety for Miss Erskine’s safety, he had forgotten to ask what had been the fate of poor Samweli. He questioned the cook upon the subject.
“Dead,” the latter answered, shaking his head. “When we got you alongside he was done for, so they just lifted you out, and sent him adrift in the boat once more. Thank your stars, my lad, you are not with him.”

CHAPTER VII
The moment Dudley closed his eyes that night he fell into a dreamless sleep, from which he did not wake till morning. The truth was, he was worn out, mentally and physically, and Dame Nature, being aware of this, stepped in to remedy matters in the one way of all others that was likely to prove most beneficial to him. Her treatment certainly succeeded, for when he woke next day he felt almost himself once more. His mind was clearer than it had been since Ben Hassein’s blow, his energies were comparatively renewed, and what was, perhaps, a surer sign that he was approaching convalescence, his appetite had in a great measure returned to him. He found the crew engaged washing down decks, and, after all he had gone through, the homely splashing of the water and the familiar tap of the squeegees upon the planks were like music in his ears. He had been very near never hearing it again.
“Now then, Uncle Ned,” cried one of the hands, in a spasm of facetiousness, when the water approached his resting-place, “ tumble off that hatch now, or we’ll see if we can wash some of the colour off you.”
As the man spoke he turned the hose full and 98

fair upon Dudley, who had to jump for the ladder leading to the foc’s’le head in order to avoid being wet through.
“He little guesses how near his words were to the truth,” he said, as he settled himself down by the starboard lighthouse. “ It’s to be hoped this wretched dye will bear out Samweli’s guarantee. If it doesn’t, my secret is certain to be discovered, and then goodbye to any help I may be able to render Miss Erskine.”
It was a perfect morning, the sea, save for a long oily swell, was as smooth and glassy as a mill-pond. From the foc’s’le head the ship looked very cool and inviting, with her white awnings and spotless decks. She was not a big craft, possibly three thousand tons at the highest calculation, but as far as her appointments were concerned she could challenge comparison with the best That she had no respect for time was evidenced by the slow progress she was making; with everything in her favour, her speed could scarcely have exceeded seven knots—possibly it was a little less. Watching her led Dudley to think of his own ship. For a moment he felt he would have given anything to have seen her heave in sight, and yet one second’s consideration was sufficient to show him that such a circumstance would not at all have suited the game he was playing. Had she overtaken the steamer, it would have been necessary for him to make his presence known, and to have returned to her forthwith; and in that case what would Miss Erskine’s fate be? He had to remember that, when all was said and done, his suspicions were only suspicions,

and for this reason he could not have gone to the Admiral and denounced Doctor Lampion on so flimsy a pretext as a half-heard conversation. No; on second thoughts, it would not suit his book at all for the Coriolanus to pick them up. He could serve Miss Erskine much better by remaining on board and protecting her from her enemies.
While the watch was at its breakfast, Dudley went in search of his friend the cook, who received him with a pleasant nod.
“ Hullo! ” said the latter, “ this looks a bit better! On your feet again, and feeling a bit peckish, I suppose ? Well, I’ll see what I can do for you.”
So saying, he deposited some food in a bowl, and handed it to him. Still acting up to his role of Arab, Dudley salaamed in response, and went forward once more to ensconce himself under the lee of the starboard lighthouse. He liked the place, because from there it was possible to obtain a view of the hurricane deck, and he could satisfy himself as to whether Miss Erskine put in an appearance there or not Meanwhile he ate his breakfast; and poor stuff though it was—bad even for a ship’s foc’s’le—enjoyed it as he had not enjoyed food for some time past. He had scarcely finished before the chief mate, accompanied by the bosun, came up the ladder and made his way along the foc’s’le head towards the spot where he was sitting.
“ Here! what’s this ? ” inquired the former, gazing wrathfully down at him. “Oh, I remember—the nigger we took aboard out of that boat! and blowing

himself out at the owner’s expense. This will never do.” Turning to the bosun, he continued—“Find some work for him, Watson, and keep him at it He can polish brass, if he can do nothing else. Let him earn his keep I We can’t feed him for nothing.”
* Ay, ay, sir! ” answered the bosun ; and then, as soon as they had inspected what it was that brought them forward, returned aft again, leaving the young man almost beside himself with rage.
Was he, Navigating-Lieutenant Dudley, of H.M.S. Coriolanus, a Queen’s officer and a gentleman, to be set to clean brass-work by a long-legged, lantern-jawed son of a Dutchman, who----- But by the time he reached this point his own good sense came to his rescue, and he had the wit to see that, even in this minor detail, Fate was working on his behalf. Furnished with such an excuse, it would be possible for him to wander about the vessel unquestioned, and perhaps, if he had a little luck, to find an opportunity of communicating with Miss Erskine unperceived. To do that, he told himself, he was prepared to clean brass-work or anything else. Accordingly, when the bosun came in search of him half an hour later, and conducted him to the deck above, where he set him to work on the brass handles of the chart-room and cabin doors, he descended upon his new employment with an alacrity that even elicited from the somewhat sceptical son of the sea an expression of his unreserved approval.
“Any one ’ud believe that he’s been at it all his life by the way he slips into it,” that individual xoz

remarked to the cook, as he passed the galley a few moments later. “ Most Arabs as I’ve a-met with in my time have been skrimshankers right through, but this one strikes me as being a bit different But there, perhaps he’s only playing a game of bluff. They’re as cunning as pet monkeys.”
Having thus expressed himself, he went aft to talk in unparliamentary language to a couple of his own men who were relashing a portion of the awning upon the poop.
“ I’ll take his hint, and not work quite so hard,” Dudley began to himself when the other had disappeared. " I must make it my business to remain here as long as possible, and that can only be done by spinning the work out”
He accordingly resumed his labour, but with somewhat less haste than before. He had finished the doors on the starboard side, and was contemplating moving round to those on the port, when the captain emerged from the cabin, and made his way towards the ladder leading up to the bridge. He was a man of medium height, broad, swarthy, and boasting a somewhat foreign caste of countenance. Could this be the same individual who had spoken yesterday, and who had been Lampion’s companion on that momentous evening at the docks ? Feeling that he should be certain to recognize his voice, Dudley waited for him to speak with an anxiety that was so great that he almost feared it might find expression on his face. To hide it he turned his head away, and pretended to devote his entire energies to the
103

A Sailor’s Bride
work he had in hand. He might have spared himself the trouble, however, for though the bosun, who had returned to the deck, addressed a question to the captain at the foot of the ladder, no answer escaped his lips; he merely shook his head and went up to the bridge.
"Never mind,” said the young man to himself, “ an opportunity will be sure to come sooner or later. I am quite certain it was his voice I heard yesterday. In the mean time I’ll watch and wait”
He was not called upon to exercise his patience for very long, however, for the captain had not been on the bridge many minutes before Lampion made his appearance at the after end of the deck. He was dressed entirely in white, and wore a hat of the same colour upon his head, while in his mouth was the invariable cigar. Whether it was the effect of the clothes, the reflection of the white awning, or the outcome of some secret agitation, Dudley could not say, but it seemed to him that the doctor looked even paler than usual this morning. So occupied was he with his own thoughts, that when he passed the spot where Dudley was seated he very nearly fell over him. The impact brought him to his senses.
“ Get out of the way, you ugly brute! ” he said angrily; and as he did so he administered a vicious kick to the man before him.
Needless to say Dudley’s first impulse was to spring to his feet and return the insult with a blow that would in all probability have landed Lampion in the scuppers. But in a flash his presence of mind 103

returned to him, and, drawing his legs out of harm’s way, he returned to his work as if nothing had happened, while Lampion, having relieved his overcharged feelings by this little act of cruelty, passed on to the ladder leading to the bridge. The officer of the watch crossed to inquire his business.
“Is the captain up there?" Lampion inquired. “ If so, tell him I should be glad to speak to him for a minute, will you ? ”
The mate did as he was requested, and a moment later the captain made his appearance, and descended the ladder.
“Good morning, doctor," he began. “As I breakfasted in my own cabin this morning, this is our first meeting. It’s going to be warm again, I’m afraid.”
Whether Lampion had any opinion on the subject will ever remain a mystery, for he did not reply to the other’s question, but waited until the skipper had joined him ; and then, taking his arm, went with him along the deck in the direction of the latter’s cabin. If, however, his speech possessed no importance for the doctor, it was of absorbing interest to the supposed Arab seated near the cabin door; it satisfied his curiosity. Now he was aware that the captain and the man who had stipulated for the payment of fifty thousand pounds, in return for a certain service, were one and the same person. There could be no doubt of it If nothing else were discovered that point at least was set at rest.
Reaching the cabin door the captain opened it, 104

and they entered together, closing it carefully behind them. It argued something for the excellence of Dudley’s disguise that they did not consider it necessary to protect themselves against his overhearing their conversation.
Little by little, making almost imperceptible progress, in order that his behaviour might not attract attention, he moved himself along the deck until he was near enough to hear their voices.
“ Well,” the captain was saying, “ what news have you for me this morning ? ”
There was a little pause; and then a voice, that Dudley scarcely recognized as belonging to Lampion, answered slowly—
“ She is not so well.”
There was another short interval Then the captain spoke again.
" You take a long time over your little affairs, I must say,” he answered, with what was probably a sneer upon his face. “ I thought, when we arranged matters in Cape Town, that it was to be done long before this.”
“ I told you that it could not be! ” Lampion retorted angrily. “ Do you want to excite the suspicions of your officers and crew, and so pave the way to our both being locked up as soon as we reach our destination ? It looks very like it”
“It will look still more like it if you keep it hanging on day after day. If you don’t look sharp I should advise you to postpone it altogether. It would be safer.”
*°S

Then followed two or three sentences that Dudley could not catch. Whatever their import may have been, they plainly had the effect of raising the captain’s anger to a still greater pitch
“ Have your way I—have your way 1 ” he cried, with a bang of his fist upon the cabin table. " But don’t blame me if anything goes wrong. Take your opportunities when they present themselves has always been my motto. You had better make it yours."
There was another break in the conversation which lasted long enough for a man to have counted fifty slowly. Then Lampion began in a more conciliatory tone—
“ Look here, my friend, it’s not a bit of use our quarrelling. We’re in the same boat in this matter, and, for the safety of both parties, it is essential that we should both pull together. It’s too late to back out or to fight over it even if we wanted to."
“ Who wants to back out ? ” inquired the captain, “ or to fight ? I don’t for one. But I do object to running my head into the hangman’s noose because you are too thin-skinned to make up your mind, and be done with the work in hand while you’re safe.”
“ I have made up my mind. You know that as well as I do.”
“ Then let’s say no more about it When do you think it will be ? ”
“ In three days’ time—that is to say, if all goes well, on Friday next,’* Lampion replied. “ Will that suit you ? ’’
“ Excellently—if you really mean what you say.
106

That will allow plenty of time for the excitement to cool down before we reach port. However well things may go, it is always best in these little matters to avoid idle chatter.”
“ In these little matters ? * cried Lampion, in a voice of horror. “ Good God ! you don’t mean to say that you’ve done this sort of thing before ? ”
“ I did not say that I had, did I ? ” returned the skipper, angrily. “ Why do you put such infernally stupid constructions on what a man says ? You say you can arrange it for Friday. Then do so, and let’s be done with it once and for all I ”
A moment later there was the sound of some one rising from a chair in the cabin, and Dudley had only time to shuffle along the deck back to his old position before the door opened and the two men emerged once more. On seeing him they looked apprehensively at each other.
Lampion, however, shook his head. “ Can’t speak English,” he said.
And then they separated, the doctor going aft and the captain returning by the ladder to the bridge.
For a while after they had gone Dudley sat where he was, feeling so sick and giddy that he could scarcely think. His suspicions were correct, then, after all ? It was against Miss Erskine’s life that these two villains were conspiring. By means of some slow poison which the doctor was administering they were encompassing her death, which Lampion had timed to take place in three days’ time. A more

hellish plot could scarcely be imagined. Brought to the verge of bankruptcy by his own improvidence and mad speculation, Lampion was determined to replenish his resources by the greatest sin it is in the power of man to commit For the sake of her wealth his sister’s child, the young girl who trusted him, was to die. And it was here upon the high seas that the vile deed was to be done.
“But not if I can help it,” said Dudley to himself. “Now that I know their plans it is with me that they have to reckon. With love on one side and hate on the other, we’ll see which can play the better game.”
So saying he returned to his work, with such excellent results that even the mate, when he passed that way, condescended to throw him a word of encouragement
For the remainder of the morning—that is to say, until eight bells, when the watch went to its dinner— Dudley stuck to his brass-cleaning, in the hope that Miss Erskine might be tempted to make her appearance on deck. He was destined to be disappointed, however, for, anxiously as he watched for her, his patience was not rewarded. Immediately he had finished his meal, which he took in his favourite place on the foc’s’le head, he picked up his apparatus and made his way aft with it The bo’sun saw him go, and made a mental note of the fact
“ That’s the first African I’ve struck that’s in any way decent” he said. “ He don’t mind work, and I only wish some of my hearties would take a lesson from him. Knows he’s finished on the hurricane

deck, and there he is going aft to the poop. There’s the making of a man in that nigger, or I’m much mistaken.”
Had he known what the supposed nigger’s real intention was, his good opinion of him would in all probability have undergone a change. Seeing, however, that he was not aware of it, he was for once in the position of a man who pays an undeserved compliment, and does not discover his mistake until too late. The truth was, Dudley was convinced, from what he had overheard that morning, that since Miss Erskine had not made her appearance, she must be feeling worse. If she were equal to taking the air at all, she would be most likely to do so on the poop during the afternoon, where she would be quieter and less likely to be disturbed. At any hazard he felt that he must see her, and before many hours were passed. Knowing what he did, he was convinced there was not a moment to lose. A day’s delay would be fatal for both of them. It was a fight against time, and every minute was strengthening the advantage the other side possessed.
With these thoughts in his mind he made his way aft to the poop, and, taking up his position beside the binnacle, began to polish the brasswork of that cumbersome but necessary piece of furniture with the same ardour that he had displayed on the hurricane deck that morning. From where he sat he could command an excellent view of the vessel, and in consequence he was able to satisfy himself that Miss Erskine could not appear on deck without his being 109

aware of the fact As it turned out, he was not very far wrong in his calculations, for the afternoon was not far advanced before the steward made his appearance from the companion ladder, carrying a rug and a couple of soft cushions, which he proceeded to arrange in a deck chair beside the saloon skylight Having done this he went below again, and a few minutes later Miss Erskine herself appeared, escorted by her uncle. Oh, how pale and ill she looked I A change was perceptible in her condition even in the short time that had elapsed since he had seen her on the previous afternoon. When he looked at her, Dudley felt his blood boil within him. He knew, however, that he must be content, for the time being at least, to hide his emotion, and to wait for the hour when it would be possible for him to release her from the network of conspiracy and murder that was fast enclosing her, and to punish her enemies as they deserved. Still polishing his brasswork, and pretending not to notice what was going on, he saw her seat herself in her chair, watched her uncle’s pretended solicitude for her comfort, and then observed him take his departure with a crafty, self-satisfied smile upon his face. In his own mind the latter imagined that everything was progressing satisfactorily towards the end he had mapped out, and he could not help showing the elation he felt at the success of his plans.

When her uncle left her, Miss Erskine endeavoured to interest herself in the book she had brought with her, but in vain. Before many minutes had passed it had slipped from her fingers, and was lying on the deck beside her. A long weary sigh escaped her, and a moment later a tear trickled down her pallid cheek. This was more than Dudley could bear. He was determined that, happen what might, he would communicate with her now or never. Accordingly, having made sure that there was no one within earshot, he moved himself along the deck until he reached the saloon skylight, when, sitting with his back towards her, and at the same time pretending to be absorbed in his occupation, he prepared to reveal his identity to her. If he should frighten her, or she should permit a cry of astonishment to escape her, the game was up; but he felt that he must chance that Sinking his voice almost to a whisper, so that it should not carry further than her chair, he murmured her name.
“Miss Erskine,” he said. “Do you recognize ?»
She was so absorbed in her own thoughts that at first she took no notice; but when he repeated his question, a low gasp issued from the chair. It was plain that at last her attention had been aroused.
“Miss Erskine/’ he murmured again. “Don’t speak too loud, but tell me if you can hear me.”
“ You uttered my name,” she answered, in a voice so low that it was with difficulty he could distinguish what she said. “ What do you want with me ? ”

In reply Dudley turned his face half towards her.
“ Do you not recognize me ? ” he asked. ° I am Lieutenant Dudley of the Coriolanus. Look at me well, so that you may be sure of the truth of what I say.”
“ Mr. Dudley,” he heard her mutter. ° Oh, what does this mean ? ”
Lest any one might be watching, he turned his face away once more and returned to his work before he answered.
“ It means that I am here to save you. You do not know what a dangerous position you are in, nor can I explain now. Tell me where your cabin is situated.” -
“Right in the stern,” she replied, still in the same quiet voice. “ But, Mr. Dudley-------”
“ Hush ! ” he continued. “ Do not say anything more for the present. Keep your porthole open to-night, and at any hazard I will communicate with you. In the mean time take no medicine which your uncle may prepare for you. Make any excuse you like, but on no account permit it to pass your lips.”
There was a slight pause, during which Dudley felt instinctively that he had frightened her out of her composure. This was the one thing of all others he wished to avoid.
“ You terrify me,” she whispered. “ What do you mean by the insinuation ? ”
“ Only that I am here to save you,” he answered. “ When the ship is quiet to-night I will discover a means of seeing you and of telling you everything.

Till then, remember my warning ; take no medicine, and don’t eat anything save what the steward himself brings you. Above all things, remember that my identity must not be suspected. Our mutual safety depends upon that.”
Then, fearing that if he remained any longer beside her suspicion might be aroused, he picked up his things and crossed the deck to the other side of the skylight, where he settled himself once more to his interminable brass. It was as well that he did so, for a few minutes later Lampion and the Captain made their appearance and joined Miss Erskine. From where he was seated Dudley could see and hear all that passed between them.
“ I trust you are feeling better this afternoon,” the Captain began, raising his hat to her as he spoke. ** It is a thousand pities that you should feel poorly just when the weather is so beautiful. However, I hope it will not be long before you are yourself once more.”
“ I prophesy that in a week from to-day she will be on her feet again,” said her uncle, as he picked up the book she had dropped and placed it upon her knee.
“ And may the lie choke you where you stand! ” muttered Dudley under his breath.
“You have taken the medicine I gave you this morning?” the doctor inquired after a little pause, during which the Captain walked to the skylight and looked down into the saloon below.
The girl answered in the affirmative.

“ Persevere with it then,” he went on; “ it will do you a world of good. When you have finished what the bottle contains I will make you a fresh supply, and after that I hope you will require no more.”
“You’re too late, Doctor Lampion,” said Dudley to himself. “Thank God you’re too late. Long before then I sincerely trust she will require no more.”
After a few moments’ more conversation, during which the Captain inquired whether there was anything else that he could do to promote his passenger’s comfort, the two men bade each other good-bye and went forward together. Dudley, having finished his work, followed their example. Not, however, before he had made his way to the stern and taken in the formation of that part of the ship, with a view to future proceedings.
To communicate with Miss Erskine by means of the porthole in question would be a difficult undertaking—he could see that; but he knew that it would be the only way in which he would be able to converse with her without running the risk of attracting attention.
The evening which followed the scene I have just described will ever be a memorable one in Dudley’s life. He spent it on the foc’s’le head, looking up at the great stars, and thinking of the interview that lay before him. Whether he would be able to reach the stern of the vessel unobserved, he could not say, but he knew that it would be the most foolish policy possible to make the attempt until the ship was quiet,

For this reason he decided that half an hour or so after eight bells, in the middle watch, would be the best time, and he accordingly set himself to wait with as much patience as he could command.
Slowly the hours wore on. The departure of each was signalled by the clanging of the bells; the watches were changed; sleepy men issued from the foc’s’le, and tired men entered into it; the ash lift grated at regular intervals, and the look-out repeated his monotonous “All’s well!” At last eight bells struck, and Dudley, who had left the foc’s’le head some little time before, and had taken up his old position on the forrard hatch, began to look about him for an opportunity of carrying out his plan. He heard the skipper leave his cabin and visit the bridge, remaining there a few minutes, and then, after a short conversation with the mate, return to bed once more. Then, when the excitement of changing the watch had subsided, he rose from his couch and slipped into the alley-way that passed the cook’s galley and the engine-room to the after-deck. Finding something to fear in every shadow, and coming to a halt at every sound, he passed the chief engineer’s cabin, crossed the spar-deck, and climbed the ladder to the poop. Under the awning it was as dark as the Pit, save where a faint light came through the skylight from the saloon below. So far he had not been noticed, but he knew that he must not congratulate himself too soon, for the most dangerous part of his errand still lay before him.
Treading softly, in order that his footsteps might ”5

not be heard in the cabins below, he approached the taffrail and looked over the counter. The latter was of the turtle-back description, and was abnormally broad and deep for a vessel of the steamer’s size. What he had seen that afternoon had been sufficient to show him that, to communicate with Miss Erskine, he would have to lower himself right over until he was on a level with the porthole. To do this was not only an extremely dangerous, but also a difficult, undertaking. However, it was too late to draw back, even if he had any desire to do so. He accordingly set to work and uncoiled a rope, upon which he had set his affections that afternoon. When he had made it into a loop, which he reckoned would be just long enough to effect his purpose, he secured one end to the poop railing, allowing the loop to drop out over the stern. Then looking round once more to make sure that he was not being watched, he mounted the rails and clambered down the turtle back on the other side. Clutching a rope in either hand, he slowly slid along until he had passed the edge, and was hanging directly over the vessel’s wake. By the time his foot rested in the loop he found that his face was almost on a level with the porthole, which, to his delight, stood open. Bringing his face as close as he possibly could to it, he whispered Miss Erskine’s name. He had scarcely done so before he heard some one moving in the cabin, and the next moment her face appeared at the opening.
" Mr. Dudley, is it really you ? ” she whispered.
“ You may set your heart at rest on that score,” 116

he responded. “ It is I, Philip Dudley, sure enough. We must not speak too loud, or somebody may chance to overhear us. I have so much to say to you, Miss Erskine.”
“ But how do you come to be here in this extraordinary disguise ? ” she inquired. “ You told me in Cape Town that you were going away upon an important mission.”
“ It was quite true,” he asserted. “I was sent by the Admiral to Mozambique to endeavour to effect the capture of a well-known Arab slaver, and, in order to do this successfully, it was necessary that I should disguise myself. I went, but I failed to secure him. Some one had warned the rascal of my attempt, and on the very day that I was preparing to seize his vessel he knocked me on the head and sent me adrift with one companion. But for the fact that you implored the Captain to examine the boat, I should not be here. I owe you my life, Miss Erskine, and I am going to repay the obligation. But we must not waste time discussing my affairs. We have quite enough to talk about and to arrange without that. You have not taken any more of the medicine of which I spoke to you ? ”
“ I have not,” she answered in a trembling voice. “ But you do not know what agonies I have suffered since you spoke to me about it this afternoon. What reason had you for saying it ? ”
He was silent a moment before he answered.
“There is not much time for explanation,” he whispered fiercely. “Let me sum it up in as few

words as possible. By this time, Miss Erskine, you must have come to some decision concerning your uncle’s character. Do you like him ? ”
“ I—I do not know that I—that I----------- Oh, Mr. Dudley, why do you ask me such a question ? ”
" Hush, hush! You must be aware that while he is an exceedingly ambitious man, he has been far from a successful one. For some time past he has stood greatly in need of money. Certain rumours have been circulated concerning him which do not redound to his credit One evening, just before I left Cape Town, I chanced to overhear a conversation between Doctor Lampion and a man whom I have since recognized as the captain of this steamer. The exact purport of the conversation I need not reveal to you now, but it was to the effect that if Doctor Lampion were sure that a certain will was made in his favour it was possible for him to obtain the money of which he stood in such need. To whom would your wealth go if anything should happen to yourself ? ”
"With the exception of a few legacies, it would pass to my uncle," she admitted. " But oh! you cannot mean that he would attempt to kill me in order to gain possession of it ? I cannot believe that he would be so wicked. You don’t know how you frighten me.”
A sob broke from her, which was followed by another, and yet another, until Dudley began to fear lest the sound might reach the saloon.
" Hush, hush! ” he whispered. “ Be silent I You do not know who may be listening. Pull yourself 118

together whatever you do. We are in such danger that one little mistake now may hurl us over the precipice, and all chance of my being able to rescue you will be gone. Your uncle is as bad a man as you could find, and the captain is his equal; but, thank God! I am here, and I intend to save you or die in the attempt. Now let us discuss our plans. I cannot remain here much longer, in case my absence should be noticed, and the ship searched for me. Listen attentively to what I say. In the first place, you must promise me that you will take no more of any sort of medicine that your uncle may give you. I leave it to you to arrange how this is to be best done. What is its colour? ”
“ It resembles water more than anything else.”
“ Then empty it out of your porthole and fill the bottle with water. Then, if by any chance he should ask you to take it in his presence, you can do so with perfect safety. Be careful to withdraw the due proportion from the bottle each time, in order that he may not suspect. Then there is one other point: where do you take your meals ? ”
“Of late I have had them brought me in my cabin. I have not felt well enough to go into the saloon.”
“ In that case continue to take them in your cabin, but do not touch them. Throw a small portion away in order that they may suppose you have eaten it, but allow what remains to go back to the galley. I am afraid you must be prepared to live on ship’s biscuit for the next few days.”

* I have some biscuits of my own,” she answered.
“ I invariably carry a supply with me on a voyage.”
“ Then eat only those. If you obey me implicitly I feel sure you will find yourself much better at once.”
“ But in that case, will they not come to the conclusion then that I have discovered their secret?” she inquired.
Dudley saw the wisdom of her remark. “ Do not allow them to suppose that you are any better,” he returned. “ Try to make them believe that you are growing gradually worse. We must not let them on any account suspect------”
“ But I cannot go on growing worse for ever,” she retorted. “ Oh, Mr. Dudley, what am I to do ? ”
“ Put your trust in me,” he replied. “ If necessary, I will give my life to save yours. I have thought of a scheme, but I must have more information on a certain point before I can put it into practice. Be brave, and we will yet come safely out of this dreadful business. Now I must go. Remember what I have said to you, and, above all, do not lose heart.”
“ I will be brave,” she responded. “ God has sent you to my assistance, and I know that you will do all you can to save me from these wicked men. I dare not think what would have happened to me if you had not come to my rescue. May God bless you I ”

CHAPTER VIII
It is perhaps as well that there should be some people in this world of ours who are content to find their compensation merely in doing what they consider to be right, without expecting in any way to be rewarded for it For a man to risk his life in a hopeless endeavour to effect the capture of a person whose imprisonment, or death, could only have an indirect bearing upon his personal career, is no doubt exceedingly meritorious, but to be willing to risk life—and all that is supposed to make it worth living—in order to save a girl who may, or may not, ultimately be something more than a friend to him, and to feel that he is well repaid if he is merely permitted to kiss her hand, is perhaps as good a proof as can be found of his singleness of purpose. This reads like an involved sentence, but it perfectly expresses the feelings that animated Dudley when he returned to the fore-part of the steamer after his interview with Miss Erskine at the stern.
Like a desperate gambler, he was staking his all upon the throw of the dice, and yet he felt he had an ample return for the trouble he was taking and the danger he was running, because she had simply

given him her hand to kiss. He could feel its touch upon his lips for hours afterwards, and every time the recollection of that moment came back to him, he resolved that whatever the upshot, however much it might cost himself, he would not turn back until he had rescued Miss Erskine from her dangerous position. But would he be able to do all that he hoped ? Would he be able to save her from the men who were so villainously conspiring against her? As if in answer, the look-out in the bows cried, “ All’s well! ” The answer came so pat upon the occasion, so apropos of the matter in hand, that he could not but regard it as an omen. *
Yes, he would save her, and then—then, perhaps when they were free once more, she would remember that he had earned some claim to her generosity. But no, he did not want that; he had no desire to be rewarded. He did not want to feel that some day she might consider it her duty, though not her pleasure, to recompense him for all that he had done for her. If she were to come to love him, it must be for himself alone, and not for any debt of gratitude she might fancy she owed him. Then, feeling certain of one thing, and that was that he had at least done a good night’s work, he curled himself up in his corner, and presently fell asleep.
When he woke next morning it was with a sense of the unreality of his position. Half asleep and half awake he endeavoured to recall his interview with Miss Erskine. He could remember all that had happened, yet, when he came to consider his own 123

curious appearance, and the strange circumstances under which that interview had taken place, he could scarcely believe that it was not a creation of his fancy. This doubt, however, lasted for only a brief period, and was succeeded by a feeling of joy when he remembered that, by warning her, he had at least put a stop to the attempt that was being made upon her life. Henceforward she would be on her guard. She would partake of nothing that would be likely to hurt her, and, as the dreadful effects of the poison she had taken since she had left Cape Town wore off, her strength would return to her.
All that now remained for him was to find some opportunity of getting her safely away. But how was this to be managed ? To attempt to leave the vessel in the daytime would be the act of a madman; to do so at night, under the most favourable circumstances, unless they had a knowledge of their whereabouts, and were satisfied that it would not be very long before they could reach land, would be almost as bad. He recalled the conversation he had overheard between the captain and Lampion, and was reminded that the latter had promised that the end should be brought about before the expiration of three days. Under these circumstances there was only one conclusion he could come to. If they wished to make their escape it must be before the third day—that is to say, on the night of Thursday. In that case he must manage to obtain a glimpse of the chart upon which was pricked out the vessel’s course. Until he knew where she was likely to be on that night he could do nothing.

Then there was another point to be considered— how, and under what circumstances, was he to lower a boat ? and then, even provided he did lower it, how should he obtain the provisions with which it was necessary she should be stocked ? After his recent experience, he had no wish to launch Miss Erskine upon the deep until he had made quite sure that her safety would be assured while she was there. It would be kinder, all things considered, to allow her to perish tbyher uncle’s hand on board the steamer than to let her suffer in an open boat as he and poor Samweli had done.
In order that he might continue to stand well with the chief mate and the bosun, as soon as he had finished breakfast he collected his brass-cleaning apparatus and departed for the hurricane deck. Just then his chief and gravest anxiety was to obtain a glimpse of the chart, and this he was determined to do at the earliest possible moment Once satisfied upon that head, he felt he would have at least made a good start, and the rest would be in a measure comparatively easy. But while he was so anxious to obtain access to the chart-room he had no desire to attract attention in so doing. He accordingly fell to work upon the brass rims of the portholes of the captain’s cabin, and gradually worked along until he found himself before the entrance to the chartroom. The captain was on the bridge at the time, and when three of the hands, who had been working in the starboard lifeboat, left her and went below, he had the deck to himself.

With his heart beating as it had never done before, he slipped into the cabin and approached the table upon which the chart, that was more precious to him than gold, was spread out How many times as navigating-lieutenant had he pored over a copy of the same sheet in the chart-room of the Coriolanus ? But how little had he imagined then that he would some day do so under circumstances such as the present Like a thief, who trembles lest he may be detected, and who finds something to fear in every sound, he leant over it and devoured it with his eyes. The vessel’s course had been most carefully pricked out up to eight bells that morning, and he was thus able to guage her present position with a fair amount of accuracy. Appropriating a pair of dividers he found lying upon the table, he worked her speed out, and discovered that she was doing, as nearly as possible, seven knots an hour. For the reason that she had maintained this rate of progress for some days past, it was only fair to suppose that she would keep it up till she turned the point of Gardafui. This being so, it was possible for him to hazard an approximate guess as to what part of the coast they would be off at midnight on Thursday. If his surmises were in any way correct, they should be somewhere abreast of the Island of Lamu, and the mere thought was sufficient to send a thrill of exultation through him.
To make my meaning clearer I must explain that Lamu is the most important town northward of Mombasa, and, as Dudley remembered with heartfelt gratitude, it is connected with Zanzibar and 126

Mozambique by telegraph. What is more, the steamers of the Deutsche Ost Afrika Company from Bombay call there every six weeks en route for Mombasa and Zanzibar! If therefore Fate favoured him, and he could only manage to leave the steamer, and to reach this place in safety, he might consider himself at the end of his troubles. But whether he could so manage it was quite another matter.
In order to clear up certain other doubts that existed in his mind, he took from the shelf above his head a copy of the “Admiralty Pilot” dealing with that portion of the African coast. He had scarcely opened it, however, before a step sounded on the deck outside. In less time than it takes to tell he had dropped into a sitting posture on the floor, and, having picked up his rags, was hard at work upon the brass handles of the chart-table. Next moment the chief mate entered the cabin.
" What! ” he cried. “ Loafing about in here, are you? On the look-out to see what you can steal? Get out, or I’ll take my boot to you! ”
Dudley had only just time to avoid the vicious kick that the other aimed at him, and to make his escape through the cabin door. How profoundly thankful he was that the mate had not caught him looking at the chart, I must leave you to imagine. Had he detected him, there is no saying what suspicions might have been aroused in his mind.

to the deck below, it was not as one who had spent an altogether useless morning.
That afternoon he once more made his way to the poop. In his own mind, he felt sure that if Miss Erskine could possibly manage it, she would make her appearance there during the afternoon. Nor was he destined to be disappointed. He had not been at work more than an hour when, as on the previous occasion, the steward made his way up to the deck, carrying the cushions and the other paraphernalia of the invalid lady. Having arranged everything he retired below again, and a few moments later Doctor Lampion and his niece came on deck. Though he pretended to be absorbed in his work, Dudley nevertheless managed to keep an observant eye on them both From her appearance, Miss Erskine seemed even weaker than she had yet been. She leant heavily upon her uncle, walked with a slower step, and when she reached her chair seated herself in it, and lay back upon her cushions with a deep sigh, as if the exertion of climbing the companion-ladder had been too much for her. Dudley glanced at Lampion’s face, and it seemed to him he could detect an expression of satisfaction upon it
“You must not give way,” he was saying, with that appearance of solicitude which he knew so well how to assume. “ It is only the heat that is affecting you, believe me. To-morrow you will be quite yourself once more. Are you sure you would rather be alone? Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to stay and read to you.”

The girl shook her head. “ No, no,” she faltered. “ I would rather be alone.”
“ As you please,” the doctor replied. “ If by any chance you should want me, you have only to call the steward, and he will fetch me.”
With that Lampion took himself off, leaving Miss Erskine to her own devices. For some minutes after he had retired she remained in her former position, her head resting on the back of her chair, and her eyes closed as if she were asleep. Then they slowly opened and she looked about her. Dudley, meanwhile, had drawn a little nearer her chair.
“ You cannot imagine how you have frightened me,” he whispered. “ I began to be afraid that you were feeling worse.”
“ On the contrary, I am much better,” she answered, with more cheerfulness in her face than he had seen there since he first came aboard. “ Did you not tell me to make my uncle believe that I was not so well ? ”
Dudley breathed more freely. He had been frightened lest she might have been forced into taking more of her uncle’s medicine.
“You are quite sure that you really da feel stronger ? ” he asked, in a low voice. “ You have not been induced to take any of that medicine ? ”
“ Neither the medicine, nor the food,” she replied.
“ I have obeyed you most conscientiously.”
There was silence for a few minutes. Then it was Miss Erskine who spoke.
“You told me last night that you would let me

know as soon as your plans were prepared,” she continued. “Have you been able to decide upon anything yet ? ”
“ I have come to the conclusion,” he answered, “ that it will be necessary for us to leave this vessel at the latest to-morrow night Do you think you can be ready then ? ”
“ I can be ready as soon as you wish,” she asserted. “You need have no fear for me. To escape from these men I am prepared to fall in with any plan you may propose. You have only to tell me what you wish done, and I will carry it out. You will see how brave I can be. Only, let me know in time.”
“I will give you plenty of warning,” Dudley answered. “ I have still many preparations to make before I can speak definitely, but get away we must to-morrow night In the mean time I must set my wits to work. The hand I have to play is an extremely difficult one, and it is imperative that there should be no mistake.”
He would have said more, had not Lampion made his appearance again at that moment, bringing with him a cup containing something that looked like beef-tea.
“ I have brought this for you,” he said. “ It will brace you.”
Miss Erskine, however, shook her head. “I do not want it,” she answered. “ I could not touch it Really I could not”
Neither the doctor’s expostulations nor his entreaties were sufficient to make her change her mind.

“She did not feel inclined for food,” she repeated, and seeing that it was useless arguing with her, her relative was compelled to admit himself vanquished. His face, however, as he placed the cup upon the skylight, afforded Dudley a good idea of the state of his feelings. For once, at least, his villainy had miscarried.
“ I will leave it here for you,” he went on. “ Perhaps, if you do not care about it now, you may like it later on. It is most essential that you should keep your strength up. So much depends upon that”
She uttered a little sigh. “ It seems to me there is more the matter with me than you let me suppose,” she said. “Do you really think, Uncle Wilfred, that I shall recover ? ”
As she said this she looked up at him with such a strange, beseeching expression upon her face, that for a moment Dudley felt tempted to believe that she must have misunderstood his own assurances.
“ Of course you will recover,” her uncle retorted, angrily, as if the question were one that should not have been addressed to him. “What is there to prevent it ? You arc merely a little run down, nothing more; all you require is time and careful treatment to set you up again. But to do that you must take my medicines.”
“ I’m afraid you think me very ungrateful, since you have been so kind to me as to give up your valuable time in order to come with me on this voyage,” she continued. “ I do not know why you should have done it”

Lampion suddenly found it necessary to walk to the break of the poop.
“ There is no necessity for you to talk of gratitude/’ he said, when he returned. “ It is only fit and proper, since I am your sole relative, that I should do what I have done. Do not let us discuss the matter further.’*
“You are too generous,” was his niece’s reply. “I can see why you do not desire me to speak. You do not wish to be thanked. I hope my poor mother in heaven can see and appreciate the true meaning of all you have done for me.”
Doctor Lampion could bear no more. Without another word he turned on his heel and vanished down the companion ladder to the saloon below. When he had gone, Dudley once more drew closer to Miss Erskine.
“ I must go forward now,” he whispered. “ I hope to be able to perfect my arrangements this evening, so that to-morrow night we may get away. It would be better, perhaps, in order to avert suspicion, that you should not come on deck to-morrow at all. They must suppose that you are not feeling well enough to move. When I am ready to communicate with you, which should be about this time to-morrow afternoon, I will do so by dropping a note tied to a string over the counter.”
“You mean over the stern, I presume,” she said.
“ Exactly, over the stern,” he answered with a smile. “You can take it in through your porthole

Whatever instructions I give you in it you must endeavour to carry out to the smallest particular.”
“ You may be sure I will do that,” was her reply.
Then bidding her good-bye, Dudley collected his materials and went forward. Successful as he had been so far, one of the most difficult portions of his scheme had still to be arranged.

That afternoon he once more made his way to the poop. In his own mind, he felt sure that if Miss Erskine could possibly manage it, she would make her appearance there during the afternoon. Nor was he destined to be disappointed. He had not been at work more than an hour when, as on the previous occasion, the steward made his way up to the deck, carrying the cushions and the other paraphernalia of the invalid lady. Having arranged everything he retired below again, and a few moments later Doctor Lampion and his niece came on deck. Though he pretended to be absorbed in his work, Dudley never* theless managed to keep an observant eye on them both. From her appearance, Miss Erskine seemed even weaker than she had yet been. She leant heavily upon her uncle, walked with a slower step, and when she reached her chair seated herself in it, and lay back upon her cushions with a deep sigh, as if the exertion of climbing the companion-ladder had been too much for her. Dudley glanced at Lampion’s face, and it seemed to him he could detect an expression of satisfaction upon it
“You must not give way,” he was saying, with that appearance of solicitude which he knew so well how to assume. “ It is only the heat that is affecting you, believe me. To-morrow you will be quite yourself once more. Are you sure you would rather be alone? Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to stay and read to you.”

The girl shook her head. 44 No, no,” she faltered. 44 I would rather be alone.”
44 As you please,” the doctor replied. 44 If by any chance you should want me, you have only to call the steward, and he will fetch me.”
With that Lampion took himself off, leaving Miss Erskine to her own devices. For some minutes after he had retired she remained in her former position, her head resting on the back of her chair, and her eyes closed as if she were asleep. Then they slowly opened and she looked about her. Dudley, meanwhile, had drawn a little nearer her chair.
44 You cannot imagine how you have frightened me,” he whispered. 441 began to be afraid that you were feeling worse.”
44 On the contrary, I am much better,” she answered, with more cheerfulness in her face than he had seen there since he first came aboard. 44 Did you not tell me to make my uncle believe that I was not so well ? ”
Dudley breathed more freely. He had been frightened lest she might have been forced into taking more of her uncle’s medicine.
44 You are quite sure that you really do feel stronger ? ” he asked, in a low voice. 44 You have not been induced to take any of that medicine ? ”
44 Neither the medicine, nor the food,” she replied.
441 have obeyed you most conscientiously.”
There was silence for a few minutes. Then it was Miss Erskine who spoke.
44 You told me last night that you would let me

know as soon as your plans were prepared,” she continued. “ Have you been able to decide upon anything yet ? ”
“ I have come to the conclusion,” he answered, “ that it will be necessary for us to leave this vessel at the latest to-morrow night Do you think you can be ready then ? ”
“ I can be ready as soon as you wish,” she asserted. “You need have no fear for me. To escape from these men I am prepared to fall in with any plan you may propose. You have only to tell me what you wish done, and I will carry it out. You will see how brave I can be. Only, let me know in time.”
“I will give you plenty of warning,” Dudley answered. “ I have still many preparations to make before I can speak definitely, but get away we must to-morrow night In the mean time I must set my wits to work. The hand I have to play is an extremely difficult one, and it is imperative that there should be no mistake.”
He would have said more, had not Lampion made his appearance again at that moment, bringing with him a cup containing something that looked like beef-tea.
“ I have brought this for you,” he said. “It will brace you.”
Miss Erskine, however, shook her head. “I do not want it,” she answered. “ I could not touch it Really I could not”
Neither the doctor’s expostulations nor his entreaties were sufficient to make her change her mind.

“She did not feel inclined for food,” she repeated, and seeing that it was useless arguing with her, her relative was compelled to admit himself vanquished. His face, however, as he placed the cup upon the skylight, afforded Dudley a good idea of the state of his feelings. For once, at least, his villainy had miscarried.
“ I will leave it here for you,” he went on. “ Perhaps, if you do not care about it now, you may like it later on. It is most essential that you should keep your strength up. So much depends upon that”
She uttered a little sigh. “ It seems to me there is more the matter with me than you let me suppose,” she said. “ Do you really think, Uncle Wilfred, that I shall recover ? ”
As she said this she looked up at him with such a strange, beseeching expression upon her face, that for a moment Dudley felt tempted to believe that she must have misunderstood his own assurances.
“ Of course you will recover,” her uncle retorted, angrily, as if the question were one that should not have been addressed to him. “What is there to prevent it ? You are merely a little run down, nothing more; all you require is time and careful treatment to set you up again. But to do that you must take my medicines.”
“ I’m afraid you think me very ungrateful, since you have been so kind to me as to give up your valuable time in order to come with me on this voyage,” she continued. “ I do not know why you should have done it.”

Lampion suddenly found it necessary to walk to the break of the poop.
" There is no necessity for you to talk of gratitude/* he said, when he returned. " It is only fit and proper, since I am your sole relative, that I should do what I have done. Do not let us discuss the matter further.”
"You are too generous,” was his niece’s reply. "I can see why you do not desire me to speak. You do not wish to be thanked. I hope my poor mother in heaven can see and appreciate the true meaning of all you have done for me.”
Doctor Lampion could bear no more. Without another word he turned on his heel and vanished down the companion ladder to the saloon below. When he had gone, Dudley once more drew closer to Miss Erskine.
* I must go forward now,” he whispered. * I hope to be able to perfect my arrangements this evening, so that to-morrow night we may get away. It would be better, perhaps, in order to avert suspicion, that you should not come on deck to-morrow at all. They must suppose that you are not feeling well enough to move. When I am ready to communicate with you, which should be about this time to-morrow afternoon, I will do so by dropping a note tied to a string over the counter.”
"You mean over the stern, I presume,” she said.
" Exactly, over the stern,” he answered with a smile. "You can take it in through your porthole

Whatever instructions I give you in it you must endeavour to carry out to the smallest particular.”
M You may be sure I will do that,” was her reply.
Then bidding her good-bye, Dudley collected his materials and went forward. Successful as he had been so far, one of the most difficult portions of his scheme had still to be arranged.

CHAPTER IX
It occurred to Dudley that evening, when he was standing on the foc’s’le head, his elbows resting on the rail, and his face looking across the sea, that once when he was a boy, inspired by some romantic story of adventure, he had wished that it might some day fall to his lot to rescue a distressed damsel upon the ocean. The kind fairy who has the dispensing of the gifts of Fate had now granted his request, and in an even more thorough manner than he could either have expected or desired.
“ If I had only known how things were going to turn out, I wonder whether I should have been so keen on it,” he said to himself. “ Heigho! what a yarn I shall have to spin, if ever I get back to the flagship again.”
He was still thinking of all that had happened since he left Cape Town, and wondering what his brother officers would say after they had heard his story, when some one came along the deck and drew up alongside him.
“ Nice sort of evening, ain’t it ? ” said his friend the cook, for it was he.
It is just possible that Dudley’s thoughts were i34

still with the subject that had been engrossing them when the cook made his appearance. Let that be as it may, it is quite certain that his command of himself was relaxed. He had forgotten for the moment that, far from being the cook’s equal, he was only a despised Arab.
“ A beautiful evening, indeed,” he answered, in his best quarter-deck style. “Just look at that touch of gold and salmon pink under the cloud yonder. It’s a gorgeous sunset, but I am not quite certain that it doesn’t mean bad weather to-morrow.”
The words had scarcely left his lips before he realized the awful mistake he had made. The other had caught him off his guard, and now the mischief was done. He felt sick and giddy, as he realized what the consequences of his forgetfulness might be.
“ I thought as much,” said the other, triumphantly. “ I had my doubts about you all along. Nice sort of Arab you are, for all your broken lingo! It’s my thinking you’d be the better for a talk with the skipper before you’re much older. White men don’t go sailing about dressed up like niggers without there being some reason for it”
Dudley tried to understand what he should do or say, but his wits seemed to have deserted him. How could he silence him? How prevent him from informing against him ? The man had always seemed a decent sort of fellow: should he throw himself upon his mercy ? One thing was certain: half measures would not do. He had gone too far to draw back.

“ I confess you have caught me,” he said. “ Whatever happens I am in your hands. If you like to do so, you can take me to the skipper, and so ruin me beyond hope of redemption.”
“ That’s the way you talk, is it ? ” said the cook, calmly knocking the ashes out of his pipe. “ Ruin you, can I ? And what might I want to be ruining you for? Tell me that! You don’t seem very far off it, as it is.! ”
Dudley was silent for a minute. There seemed to be no other course open to him but to pin his faith on this man.
“I wonder if I can trust you with my terrible secret ? ” he began at last, looking the other fairly and squarely in the face. Until that moment he had never known what it was to have life, happiness, and what was more terrible still, the life and happiness of another, dependent upon a stranger’s whim. “ You have been a very good friend to me, and I think I will run the risk.”
“Fair and easy now, my lad,” the cook replied. “Before we come to talking about terrible secrets, let’s have an understanding. You don’t know me and I don’t know you; when you come to think of it, you’ll see that, and you may say more in a minute than you’d be able to take back all your life. I’ve had my doubts about you ever since I went down into that boat and helped to get you aboard. You may thank me for keeping to myself what I heard when you came to again, and, what’s more, for having prevented the hands from having found it out too. I don’t 136

say but what I’d like to hear what it is that has brought you down to what you are now, but I don’t want you to tell me anything unless you feel sure that you can trust William Blake—that’s me—to hold his tongue. One other word first If there’s anything in it that’s likely to get you or me into trouble, keep your mouth shut. I’ve a wife and three kiddies at home, and I’m not going to run no risk, Mark that I Now make up your mind.”
“My mind is made up,” Dudley returned. *1 do honestly believe I can trust you. God knows I want to be able to do so; for I want a friend just now more than ever I did in my life. I doubt very much whether you could find a man in this world in such a desperate position as I am at this moment. If you will listen I will tell you everything, and leave it in your power to help me, or not, as you may feel disposed.”
Without more ado, leaning upon the rail, with his back towards the hurricane deck and his face towards the darkening sea, Dudley told his story. He revealed his identity, described the futile attempt to effect the capture of Achmet ben Hassein, and last, but not least, made the man beside him acquainted with the terrible fate that had been arranged for Miss Erskine. The cook heard him out, his face growing graver at every stage of the other’s narrative.
“ If what you say is true, then the skipper of this boat is a bigger blackguard than ever I thought him, and that’s saying a good deal. But how am I to know that it is ? ”

“I can only give you my bare assurance,” said Dudley. “It is not in my power to------------But stay. I believe there is a way in which I can prove it to you. This afternoon when I was cleaning brasswork on the poop, Doctor Lampion brought the young lady a cup of beef-tea. She did not drink it, and it was left upon the skylight. Where is it
“The steward must have had it,” the cook replied. “There isn’t much passes his mouth. But what has a cup of beef-tea to do with it ? ”
“ If you want to be convinced of the truth of my assertion, get possession of the contents of that cup, and give it to one of those kittens in your galley. It is possible, of course, that it may not have been tampered with; but if it has, you may be quite sure that it will have an effect upon it Go and get it, and I will wait here for the result”
The man departed on his errand, and was absent for upwards of a quarter of an hour. When he returned, it was with a white and solemn face.
“By God!” he said, “I believe you are right after all The villains! The bloodthirsty, sneaking villains! To think that they should be wanting to murder a sweet young lady like that! ”
“ But why do you come back in this state ? ” Dudley inquired eagerly. “What have you discovered ? ”
“ I am willing to own that at first I did not quite believe what you said about the poisoning,” the cook replied. “ The beef-tea was hocussed, as sure as you’re 133

alive, for there’s been the deuce and all to pay aft there to-night.”
“ What do you mean ? ”
“ I mean that the steward went up and fetched the cup from off the skylight, and, being his own greedy self, put it inside him as soon as he could—that it shouldn’t be wasted, so he says. He hadn’t got it down more than half an hour before he began to feel terrible pains a-creepin’ round inside him. Then he was suddenly taken all of a heap. * That there beeftea’s out of a bad tin,’ cries he, ‘ and I’m poisoned! I’ll never live to see old England again.’ With that he begins to groan, and shake all over, turning a nasty grey colour, so that the boy went off to find Doctor Lampion. ‘Doctor,’ says the steward, ‘I’m a-going to die. I’ve taken one of them beef essences, an’ it’s fairly clawed me up. Put me out of my misery, for I’m suffering all the pains of hell.’ ”
“ And what did Doctor Lampion say ? ” Dudley asked, with an eagerness that showed the interest he was taking in every word the other uttered.
“ From what the steward’s boy tells me—mind you, they’ve kept it all to themselves aft, by the Doctor’s orders—Lampion was fairly taken aback. He turned as white as a sheet, and palmed it off by saying that he’d do all he could to pull him round, making out that he was so fond of the steward that he couldn’t bear to see him so ill.”
“And what reason did he offer for the man’s condition ? ” Dudley inquired.
The quick change of expression on the cook’s i39

face furnished him with his answer before he had time to put it into words.
“ He wanted to make out as how it was all my fault for opening a bad tin, and he went so far as to say that if anything happened to the steward he’d hold me responsible. The murderer! It’s a good thing for me, sir, that you let me know what was in the wind. If I hadn’t ha’ been told beforehand, I should have believed it was my doing.”
“But you didn’t allow them to suppose that you knew anything of their plot against Miss Erskine?” Dudley continued, in some alarm.
“ I didn’t breathe a word about it, sir,” retorted the cook. “ It’s not likely I should, seeing how matters stand. But I’m not going to have that Lampion, big man as he is, trying to make out that I want to poison my shipmate, when it’s himself as did it all. ’Tisn’t human nature.”
Dudley did not reply for a moment Here was his opportunity, and, whatever happened, he must make the most of it
“ Look here, Blake,” he began, when he had fully considered the matter, “you have now had good proof that the terrible charge I have brought against Doctor Lampion and the Captain is not founded on mere suspicion, have you not ? ”
“ That I have, sir, and sorry I am to have to say so.”
“I have told you that I am an officer of the Queen’s Navy, and I might even go so far as to say that I am here, at this moment, by the express orders

of Admiral Redfurn, the Commander-in-Chief of the South African station. Though I don’t look like it, as I stand now, I am nevertheless fairly well off. Miss Erskine, the young lady whom they are so basely trying to murder, is immensely wealthy, and it is to get possession of her money that Doctor Lampion, her uncle, is attempting her life, and the Captain is assisting him. As a proof of what I am saying, the Captain is to receive no less a sum than fifty thousand pounds for his share in the transaction. Now, I’ll tell you what I will do, Blake. If you are willing to help me to escape from this vessel to-morrow night with Miss Erskine, I will give you a written order on my bankers in London to pay you the sum of one thousand pounds, and will leave it to Miss Erskine’s generosity, which I feel sure you will not doubt, to add the same amount. What do you say ? ”
The man drummed with his fingers on the rail before he replied.
“ What you say is all right, sir,” he returned, ° and I’m not going to argue that it ain’t very generous on your part. It seems to me that you are willing to pay a lot of money for what ain’t a very big thing after all. That you’re in a fix, I don’t deny; but, when you come to look at it, a couple of thousand pounds is a rare big sum—and how do you know I shouldn’t give you away at the last moment ? Such things has been done by better men nor me. I might bilk you, and you’d be none the wiser.”
“ In all probability I should not. At any rate, I am willing to trust you. You’re a good sort of fellow, 141

Blake, and you’re not going to lead me to suppose anything to the contrary.”
“ I don’t want you to suppose anything,” said Blake. “ I only want to let you see that I mean to be straightforward with you. You’re going to put a couple of thousand pounds’ worth of trust in me, and what I want is for you to be satisfied in your own mind that I’m not trying to take advantage of you. I’ll help you to get away from this here vessel with the young lady if I can ; and I’ll leave it to you, sir, to pay me afterwards whatever you may think the job is worth. I know the young lady’s got money, and you say you have. Mind, I’m not saying you ain’t telling the truth ; but how am I to know to the contrary ? ”
“You have my word for it,” Dudley replied, with a sharpness for which next moment he was sorry. “ If you don’t believe me, I can say no more.”
“ Fair and softly, sir,” the man answered. * Don’t lose your temper, when there’s no. occasion for it You don’t see what I am driving at What I want you to understand is as follows. You say you’re willing to pay me for helping you, but I don’t know as how you’ve got the means to do it I’m willing to help you, but how do you know I’m not going to the skipper directly your back is turned ? Don’t you see, sir, how we stand? We’ve both got to trust each other. I’m ready for my part What do you say to yours ? ”
“I have already said that I will trust you,” Dudley returned. “ And I am even more inclined to do so since you have spoken so fairly.”

“ You know how to put your words together, at any rate,” said the cook. “ Howsomever, that’s neither here nor there. The Captain and that Doctor Lampion between them are serving the young lady a scurvy trick; but we’ll outwit them. Now, sir, tell me what you want me to do. Let me into your plans, and I’ll see if I can’t fall in with them.”
Thus encouraged, Dudley revealed what was in his mind.
“To-morrow night,” he said, “I must by some means get possession of one of the ship’s boats. She must be stocked with provisions, and, if we have the good fortune to get away without attracting attention, we must endeavour to reach the coast in her. Before I leave, I must also find a suit of clothes; for if I were to land like this, it is scarcely likely any one would believe my story. You are about my height; have you a suit you can spare me ? ”
“ You’re very welcome to anything I have got,” the man answered. “If you’ll accept my things, I fancy I can rig you out. The boat, when you come to think of it, is a more serious matter. Whichever way you look at it, she belongs to the ship, and to take her is no more nor less than stealing, is it ? Of course, I don’t say but what you’d be right in collaring her, seeing how you are situated; but you must see for yourself, sir, that it wouldn’t do for me to be mixed up in it.”
“And what about the provisions?” Dudley inquired, with some apprehension ; for by this time he had come to see that he had to deal with a character.

“ If you won’t help me to get possession of the boat, how can you reconcile letting me have them ? ”
" Very easily,” returned the other. “I reckon Miss Erskine’s paid for her passage, hasn’t she? Well, that being so, she’s entitled to be fed by this ship until she reaches her destination. There’s nothing wrong with that, I hope ? ”
He looked so slyly at Dudley as he said this, that the latter felt compelled to smile, in spite of the gravity of the situation.
* Then I may count on the food, at any rate,” he remarked. “ As for the boat, since I must have it, the better plan would be for me to give you a letter to the Captain, which you can place somewhere so that he will be sure to see it. In it I will tell him that I have taken the boat, and whatever hire he may place upon it shall be paid immediately upon application to Lieutenant Dudley, of Her Majesty’s ship Coriolanus'1 .
“ I should reckon that would about meet the case,” said the cook. “ Now we’ve settled about the clothes, the provisions, and the boat: what else is there I can do to help you ? ”
“ I shall want your assistance in lowering the boat That is all. After that your responsibility ceases.1’
“ I’ll help you to lower her, and I only hope you will come safely out of it,” answered the man. “ I must say as how you deserve to. When I think of those two villains, and the chief mate’s about as bad as either of them, trying to take the life of that

innocent young lady, well, it fairly makes my blood boil.”
After a few more moments’ conversation, the cook bade him good night, and went off to his quarters.
“Heaven send I have done right,” murmured Dudley to himself, when he was alone once more. “ I've put my trust in the man, and he has it in his power to upset all my plans and to ruin us hopelessly. Somehow, I don’t think he will, however. If I know anything of the human countenance, his is an honest one. The rest is with Allah.”
An hour or so later he left the foc’s’le and returned to his favourite spot on the forrard hatch. There he composed himself to sleep, feeling that, since he had left it last, he had made as favourable progress as he could well have hoped to do. All that remained now was to arrange about the lowering of the boat, and to settle the means whereby Miss Erskine was to be brought up from her cabin and placed in it He had also to decide the exact time of their departure, in order that she should know when to be ready, so as not to run any chance of keeping them waiting. With a feeling of thankfulness in his heart for the little he had been able to accomplish, he settled himself down to rest, but, though the deck was deserted, and he himself was quite prepared for slumber, he was not to be permitted to sleep, as he had hoped to do. He had scarcely closed his eyes before a hand was laid upon his shoulder, and he looked up to find the cook standing beside him. For a moment he could only

suppose that something had gone wrong, and that the man had come to warn him. Fortunately, however, this was not the case.
“ I have come to say,” the other whispered, “ that if you care to turn into my bunk you’re welcome to do so. Nobody will be any the wiser, and you can be out of it again before they wash down.”
Dudley thanked the man, but declined his hospitable offer. While recognizing the kindliness which had prompted it, he had no desire to allow the cook to run any risk of getting into trouble through his fault If, by any chance, one of the officers should pass the cabin and find him there, it might lead to other discoveries, and perhaps result in the total failure of their plans. He said as much to the man.
“As you please, sir,” he answered. “You may be right. But if you change your mind, I hope you will remember you are heartily welcome.”
“I am quite sure of that,”returned Dudley. “And I give you my hearty thanks for the offer. By the way, do you happen to have heard how the steward is?”
“He is a bit better, sir,” the cook replied. “I went aft to see a few minutes ago. Doctor Lampion has been making a mortal fuss of him. He’s been shoving a pump down his throat, I understand, and fairly took hold of the inside of him. I reckon they thought they’d half killed the wrong man between them.”
“ It’s a wonder they didn’t quite do so,” Dudley 146

remarked. * It would have been a bad day’s work for them if they had. And now, good night I cannot thank you enough for the kindness you have shown me.”
When the cook had disappeared, Dudley composed himself for sleep once more. Try how he would, however, he could not go off. The excitement of the evening alone, to say nothing of the dangerous nature of his position, was sufficient to destroy any chance of slumber. His excited brain went over the situation again and again, with the result that the more he considered it, the uglier it looked. It was true he had been fortunate to secure an ally in the person of the cook; but while he might consider that a point gained, it was one that could be of no real advantage to him unless everything else went equally well. So far as he could see, the success of the plan he had formed depended almost entirely upon his being able to get Miss Erskine into the boat, and the boat into the water, without attracting the attention of the officer of the watch or any* members of the crew. At first glance this seemed impossible. He remembered that the moon was well-nigh at the full, and, for the first time in his life, he felt that he had a grievance against the Goddess of the Night However, it was no use meeting trouble half-way. He had to look his difficulties in the face, and combat them as they arose. Still, the feeling of uncertainty that hung over everything was sufficient to spoil his rest, and to keep him tumbling and tossing about on the hatch-top long after he should have been asleep.

Next morning, when he went to the galley to obtain his breakfast in the usual fashion, the cook received him with a greater assumption of mystery. Dudley noticed that he no longer greeted him with either familiarity or facetiousness. He did not address him as his “ dusky beauty,” or accuse him of having “ forgotten to wash his face,” as he had been wont to do at an earlier stage of their acquaintance.
“Good morning, sir,” he whispered. “You don’t know what a time I’ve had of it, thinking over all you told me last night. If anybody had said to me, when we left Cape Town, that all this was going to happen, I wouldn’t have believed them. I give you my word I wouldn’t But since I’ve been thinking it over, and putting two and two together, I find I can understand a lot of things that puzzled me before. Howsomever, this is no time to be talking of them now. What can I give you for breakfast ? It won’t do for the crew to see you have anything out of the way, but if you like I can slip a few better things under your rice, and you can get them out yourself when you have the chance and there’s nobody looking.”
“No, no,” Dudley replied. “Let me go on as before. If all goes well this will be the last morning that I shall have to play the part of an Arab. Now, what have you decided about the provisions for the boat to-night ? Will you have them ready ? ”
“They’re quite ready now,” the man returned. “ I’ve got them put away in a box under my bunk. I can have them out at a moment’s notice. And that
148

reminds me you haven’t told me yet which boat you intend to take.”
“ The port quarter-boat,” Dudley answered. “ She will be easier to get at and to lower than any of the others. I had better tell you now, while I have the opportunity, what my arrangements are. I worked it all out in the night. I shall not make any attempt to get away until after midnight, and then only when the watch has had time to settle down. Miss Erskine will be on the look out for us, and a line thrown over the stern alongside her port will be sufficient to let her know that it is time to come on deck. She will join us at once and take her place in the boat, which we shall then lower with as much speed as possible. It will be a risky proceeding, on account of the way the vessel will have on her; but that can’t be helped. We must risk something, and, after all, she is only doing seven knots. As soon as she is afloat I shall lower myself down into her, unhook the tackles, and drop quietly astern. You must then go forward as quickly and with as little noise as possible. I leave it to you, when the trouble comes, and the skipper questions you, to say whether you know anything about the matter or not.”
“ I shall know how to take care of myself. You need not be afraid, sir, about that,” the other replied.
“ I am glad to hear it Now give me my breakfast, and let me get forward with it We don’t want the hands to think we’re on too friendly terms. Some of them are watching now, and they may remember the circumstance afterwards.”

So saying he salaamed gravely, took up his bowl of rice, and, having left the galley, departed to eat his breakfast in his usual place on the forrard hatch. The • crew off duty were similarly employed, and Dudley noticed that one of them, a young fellow some six or seven and twenty years of age, to whom he had taken an intense dislike, had seated himself within a few yards of him, and was watching him with inquisitive eyes. It had struck him on several occasions that this youth seemed to take a greater interest in him than was altogether consistent with his humble character; but whether he suspected anything, Dudley could not, of course, tell The thought, however, that he might have some suspicion that he was not the Arab he pretended to be, was sufficient to cause him considerable anxiety. To let the other see that he was aware of his attention would, however, have been the greatest folly possible, so he continued his meal with as apparent unconcern as if the man were a hundred miles away from him.
After breakfast, following the custom of the past few days, he commenced his interminable brasscleaning. Miss Erskine, he felt sure, would not make her appearance on deck that day, and he was anxious, if possible, to learn what sort of report her uncle would make concerning her to the Captain. That they would take counsel together he was quite convinced, and it was his intention to be an unseen participator at that interview. How this was to be managed he did not as yet understand, but he trusted to the luck that had hitherto stood him in

such good stead to arrange it satisfactorily. Arguing out the pros and cons of the matter, he came to the conclusion that it was extremely unlikely that the two men would talk anywhere but in the Captain’s cabin, and for this reason Dudley determined to locate himself within sight of that compartment He was destined to wait somewhat longer than he anticipated, however, for it was close upon eight bells before Lampion emerged from the cuddy, and walked with what was evidently intended to be a careless air towards the ladder which led to the hurricane deck. Dudley, who was at work upon the brasses of the engine-room skylight, kept his eye upon him, and, as soon as he had seen him pass along the starboard side of the deck towards the Captain’s door, he left the skylight and made his way to a point under the ports of the cabin in question. Then he strained his ears to catch any sound that might come from within. Both men’s nerves were overstrung by anxiety. Their voices told him as much.
“ Well ? ” said the skipper, by way of introduction. “ And how is she to-day ? Any change to report ? ”
There was a pause before Lampion replied. When he did Dudley scarcely recognized his voice; it was curiously husky and uncertain.
“It is the beginning of the end,” he answered. Then he stopped, and there was a noise like that made by some one sinking heavily into a chair.
“ Come, come,” began the skipper in an aggrieved tone, “ pull yourself together, man. You’re trembling like a leaf.”

He must have crossed the cabin, for a moment later there was the clinking of glass, followed by the sound of liquid being poured from a bottle.
“Drink that,” said the Captain. “ You look as if you need it. It will put a bit more heart into you. Now what have you got to tell me ? ”
Lampion said something which Dudley could not catch, to which the Captain retorted angrily, and with an oath.
“ I’ll be dashed if the man’s not drunk, and on the one day of all others that he should have been most careful to keep his wits about him I ”
“Drunk ? Who says I’m drunk ? ” Lampion replied huskily, and with a great assumption of dignity. M If you do, Captain, you lie, and I tell you so to your face. You’d better not insult me. I’ve warned you. Do I look or talk as if I am drunk? Small blame to me if I were, seeing what we’ve done between us.”
He spoke with so much bitterness, that the Captain derived a wrong impression from his words.
“ She is dead, then ? ” he exclaimed ; and in his excitement he must have knocked one of the tumblers off the table, for there was the sound of breaking glass, followed by a long silence.
“ She is sinking fast,” muttered the wretched Lampion, after the pause to which I have referred. “ O Heavens, what brutes we are ! ”
“ Thank you kindly for the compliment, my friend,” the Captain retorted. “1 must admit you express yourself very eloquently. Perhaps you will

tell me next that you’ve only done it for my sake.”
" I begin to wish I had never had anything to do with it”
Here the Captain’s temper fairly gave way.
“ Hold your silly tongue,” he whispered hoarsely. "Have you gone mad, that you talk like this? I don’t mind your getting drunk, but I am not going to let you start that sort of raving. You’ll land us both on the gallows if you do. Remember that both our necks depend upon your keeping your head for the next few days. Let me know when all is over, and I’ll take command. In the mean time, if you touch another drop of liquor without my consent, by Jingo! I’ll clap you in irons, so mark my words.”
Dudley felt that he had heard enough; he accordingly crept quietly away, and was fortunate enough to reach the deck below, before Lampion made his appearance from the cabin. Though he knew in his heart that Miss Erskine would certainly not have taken any of the medicine, or have eaten any food that was offered her, he could not repress a feeling of anxiety at the doctor’s news. A medical man of his standing and experience would scarcely allow himself to be imposed upon so easily. In a case like the present it seemed well-nigh impossible that he would be guided merely by the patient’s apparent condition, without verifying it for himself. This, however, was afterwards proved to be the case.
As he made his way along the alley way, which, as I have said elsewhere, led past the engine-room to i53

the forrard deck, a man knocked violently against him. It was done with such evident purpose that to deem it an accident was impossible. As good fortune had it, however, Dudley’s presence of mind did not desert him. It enabled him to substitute an exclamation in Arabic for the English expression which, a moment before, had trembled on the tip of his tongue. He was thankful that he had had the wit to do so, when he realized that his assailant was none other than the young seaman who had watched him so closely on the hatch that morning.
M I’ll learn you to get out of my way, my beauty,” the latter remarked, as they approached the galley door. So saying, he aimed a blow at Dudley that caught him on the jaw, and sent him staggering back against the bulkhead. It was so entirely unexpected, that for a moment the recipient was taken completely aback. When he recovered himself, he was about to rush at the youth and furnish him with the fellow to the blow, when the cook emerged from his cabin and stepped between them.
“Now then, you Tomkins,” he cried, “what’s your little game anyway ? Want your comb cutting, do you, my cockrel ? Well, if you don’t keep your hands off that Arab there, I’ll see if I can do it for you. Can’t fight a white man, but must try your hand on a poor chap who hasn’t properly recovered from the trouble we got him out of the other day. Let me hear of your lifting your hand on him again, and I’ll walk round you, so that you won’t know yourself for a week of Sundays.”
154

Tomkins muttered something under his breath about cooks and Arabs and their uses in the world, and on board ship in particular, and slouched forward.
“ I was mortally afraid you’d hit him, sir,” said the cook, when the other was safely out of hearing. “ If you had, there’d ha’ been a fight, sure enough, and then the skipper would have put you in irons as soon as look at you. There’s times when you’ve just got to be a Christian, and take a whack on the cheek and not give another back in place of it This is one of them. For the young lady’s sake that’s in her cabin aft there, keep out of that fellow’s way. He’s a special favourite of the skipper and the chief officer, and you can see for yourself that he don’t like you over and above.”
44You need not be afraid,” said Dudley. "I’ll keep out of his way. But if ever I meet him ashore let him beware, for he shall feel the weight of my fist Now, if you’ll give me my dinner, Til go forrard. How I wish night would come! This suspense is too trying. By the way, I want a pencil, a piece of paper, and some string. I must write my note to Miss Erskine this afternoon, and must make sure that she gets it”
The cook furnished him with the articles he required, and when he had concealed them under his jibba, he went forrard. That afternoon he made his way to the poop as usual, and while he was at work upon the binnacle, wrote his note to Miss Erskine, telling her, in detail, all the arrangements he had made for their escape that night.

It had suddenly occurred to him that it was within the bounds of possibility that Doctor Lampion, knowing his niece’s desperate condition, might be in the cabin at the moment, and that, seeing something fluttering about outside the port, he might take it in, and so become cognizant of their arrangements. Screwed up to such a pitch as he was, the thought was almost more than he could bear, and he sank back beside the binnacle, feeling as if the last straw had been laid upon his already overburdened shoulders, and that every hope was gone. At last he managed to get himself somewhat in hand, and a quarter of an hour or so after he had thrown the packet over once more approached the rail. Having made sure that he was unobserved, he pulled in the string. The note was gone—somebody had taken it. It would have been a very big price that Dudley would have paid at that moment to have known who that somebody was. But he would know in time, and for the next eight hours there was nothing for it but for him to possess his soul in patience.

CHAPTER X
I SCARCELY fancy, if you were to ask Dudley to-day how he spent the remainder of that afternoon and evening, he would be able to tell you. He has a dim recollection of standing on the foc’s’le head and watching the moon rise, and of wondering where he and Miss Erskine would be when next she made her appearance. He confesses to having been so nervous that he looked for an enemy in every man who approached him, and to have found something suspicious in every sound and shadow. He came to no harm, however. The vessel ploughed her way through the water, tossing off the foam on either bow; the officer of the watch paced up and down the bridge, pausing now and again to look out to sea; while the monotonous clatter of the ash-tip, and the occasional cry of the look-out man, were the only sounds that could be heard. Dudley, to pass the time, tried to picture the Captain and Lampion, and wondered how they thought, if they dared to do so, of the poor girl they were murdering so cruelly. Lampion had offered an expression of his sorrow when he was with the Captain that morning, but was that to be taken as the outcome of the liquor he had drunk ? or was it i57

the result of a very real fear for his own safety? In all probability it was a mixture of both.
About eleven o’clock Dudley came to the conclusion that the time for action had arrived. Until then he had been afraid to leave the deck, lest his absence should be noticed and suspicions aroused. Now, however, he felt that he dared not postpone it any longer. There was so much to do, even before they could go aft and get to work upon the boat, that every moment was of supreme importance. Accord-in^y> he rose fr°m the hatch, and went down the alley-way to the cook’s cabin. The door was ajar, and he could see its owner lying in his bunk reading. Dudley stepped inside, and, having done so, bolted the door carefully after him.
Descending from his bunk the cook produced a suit of clothes from a chest, and spread them out for the other’s inspection.
“ I hope they’ll come somewhere near fitting you, sir,” he said anxiously. “We are not very far off the same build.”
Dudley, not to waste time, sat down and tried them on, to discover that they fitted him admirably. He felt like a new man. The cook was plainly impressed with the change in his appearance.
“ You look a regular toff and no mistake, sir,” he was good enough to remark.
“ So much for the clothes,” Dudley replied. "Now for the letter to the skipper.”
So saying, he seated himself beside the neat little chest of drawers, which furnished one side of the 153

cabin, and, dipping the pen he took from the rack into the ink, he composed a letter to the skipper. In it he informed him of his identity, and also of his reasons for taking possession of the provisions and the boat Both he asserted would be handsomely paid for as soon as he reached civilization. That literary effort finished, he was about to rise, but he stopped himself.
" Now that I’ve a pen in my hand,” he said, " I’ve a good mind to write a line to our friend Lampion, just to let him know what I think of him. It will make him feel a trifle uneasy as to the fate which is in store for him when next we meet”
He accordingly set to work again, and when his letter was finished, sealed and addressed it. While he had been thus occupied, the cook had been rummaging at the bottom of his chest
14 I’ve something here, sir,” he said, " if I can only find it, that may be of use to you when you get ashore. If you’ll take it I give you my word you’re very welcome to it”
A moment later he discovered what he wanted, and handed to Dudley a formidable "Colt’s” revolver and a tin box of cartridges.
"Take it, sir,” he began solemnly. "You don’t know how handy you may find it when you get ashore. It’s no use to me, and by right I oughtn’t to have it It will only save me a wigging if you will take it”
"I’ll do so with a thousand thanks,” Dudley answered. " It was the one thing of all others I

wanted, and did not know how to procure. That rascal ben Hassein robbed me of my own. I’m afraid I’m getting very deep in your debt, Blake. You’d better let me write that letter to my bankers, and at the same time you must furnish me with your address in England.”
“ As you please, sir,” the man replied, and handed him another sheet of paper.
Dudley thereupon wrote an order upon the banking firm who had the care of his money, authorizing them to pay William Blake the sum of one thousand pounds sterling, and handed it to him.
“ Thank you, sir,” he said simply. * I’ve never touched so much money in my life before, nor a quarter of it. It’s my hope you and the young lady may come out of this big bit of trouble as safely as you deserve. There’s my London address written on this card. Perhaps you will let me know how you get on, if you’ve time to spare for writing. I must say as how I should like to know.”
“ You may be very sure I shall tell you,” returned the other. “And now, if all is ready, we had better be seeing about the boat Heaven grant we may reach the poop without being observed. What is the time ? ”
“ Close on eight bells,” responded the cook.
“In that case,” retorted Dudley, “we’ll wait here until the watch is changed and the officer has gone his rounds. Then, when all is quiet once more, we’ll get aft as quickly as possible.”
The words were scarcely spoken before the bell 160

sounded. Five minutes or so later—for he was seldom punctual—the steps of the chief officer sounded on the deck above them, and two or three minutes more elapsed before the mate he relieved passed on his way aft The men in the cabin waited until they heard him go into his own berth and shut the door. Then they crept quietly out into the dark alley-way, and, carrying the beaker of water and the box of provisions, in their turn made their way aft It was not until they reached the poop that they felt as if they might venture to breathe. Putting the water down, Dudley crawled under the awning, and began to cast loose the canvas cover of the boat This done the stores were lifted in and made secure. As he observed with satisfaction, she contained her full complement of oars, a mast, and a handy sail. He slipped the rowlocks into their holes, and then, being satisfied that everything was in order, turned to leave her. Before doing so, however, his sailor’s instinct made him throw a glance round the horizon. During the day he had noticed certain symptoms in the sky, which seemed to prognosticate a change in the weather. Heavy clouds had come up since nightfall, and now, as good fortune had it, the moon was almost obscured. Nevertheless, he could not say that he was any too well pleased to see the change. He knew with what rapidity gales spring up on the East Coast of Africa, and he had not the least desire to be caught in one while in an open boat

stead on a previous occasion over the stern. In a very few seconds now he would know whether Lampion or Miss Erskine was the possessor of the note he had written that afternoon.
“Stand by the companion-ladder to give Miss Erskine a hand with her parcel, will you ? ” Dudley whispered to Blake. “I must get some of this awning unlashed so that she can get into the boat”
He climbed on to the rails again, while the cook disappeared into the dark companion. To unlash that part of the awning alongside the boat was the work of only a few minutes, and when it was finished, he waited impatiently for Miss Erskine. She did not come, however. Five minutes went by, and still she did not put in an appearance.
“ Good heavens ! ” said Dudley to himself, “ what can be the reason of this delay ? Why doesn’t she come ? Somebody may come aft and find us here, and then we shall be done for.”
At last he could bear the suspense no longer ; he accordingly descended from the rail and approached the companion. The cook was still standing inside, but there was no sign of Miss Erskine either on the ladder or in the dimly lighted saloon. Then, while they were waiting, they heard a door at the further end open, and some one come out
“ Thank God ! ” Dudley muttered; and was about to descend a few steps in order to help the girl with her parcel, when there was the sound of a fall followed by a hasty curse.
162

* My God! it’s Lampion, and he has discovered everything,” Dudley muttered to himself.
For a moment he felt inclined to rush down into the saloon, to hurl himself upon Lampion, and, after he had silenced him, to carry Miss Erskine off bodily before the alarm could be raised. Before he could move, however, the cook reached him, and held up his hand to him to be silent and remain where he was. Side by side they waited and watched. They saw Lampion struggle to his feet, stand for a moment clutching at the table, and then reel off across the saloon in the direction of his own cabin.
“The man’s drunk,” whispered Dudley. “What are we to do ? ”
“ Wait where we are for a minute and see what happens,” his companion replied. “You may take my word for it this is what has kept the young lady.”
His patience, however, was destined to be sorely tried. For upwards of ten minutes not a sound was to be heard in the saloon. They had almost given up hope when a female form stole into the lamplight and came towards the ladder. There could be no mistake about it this time. It was Miss Erskine herself without a doubt.
Knowing that the steward was still confined to his bunk, and would not be likely to suspect anything, and that Lampion was not in a condition to appreciate what was going on around him, Dudley descended the companion-ladder and went to meet her.
“ Thank God you have come,” he whispered as he 163

took the roll of shawls she carried. " You can have no idea what agony I have suffered on your account.”
Without answering, she accompanied him up the ladder to the deck above. As soon as they had reached it, Dudley showed her the boat, and in an undertone informed her how she was to enter it. She was evidently prepared for anything, for she climbed the rail without demur.
" We are going to lower the boat with you in it,” Dudley began, when she was seated. “Hold on tight and do not be afraid. I shall join you as soon as she is in the water.”
She nodded to show that she understood, and then Dudley and the cook seized the falls and commenced to lower away. It was no easy matter, and as Dudley heard the fall-ropes whining through the sheaves, he wondered that the whole ship was not aroused by the noise they made. Little by little the boat went down, the two men watching her descent with evident anxiety.
" I think she is all right now,” said the cook, as she began to draw through the water.
Then, throwing a rope overboard, Dudley prepared to join her. He made the end fast, and had already set his foot upon the lower rail, when an exclamation from the cook induced him to turn back.
"What was that?” he cried, turning quickly round.
As he spoke, a dark figure made its appearance from behind the companion hatch. Knowing that the man’s presence boded no good, Dudley made

a rush at him. On the verge of liberty as they were, he was not going to allow his plans to be overthrown in this fashion. His anger was increased a hundred-fold when he discovered that the interloper was none other than the man, Tomkins, who had pushed against him so roughly that morning.
“ What’s up now ? ” cried the latter. “ Trying to sneak away from the ship, are you ? Well, Arab or no Arab, you don’t do it while I’m about”
He had turned his face forward, and was about to give the alarm when Dudley seized him by the throat with his left hand.
“ I’m in your debt already,” he muttered hoarsely.
So saying, he struck him a heavy blow with his right Then pushing him back against the mizzenmast, he continued his punishment until his adversary fell prone upon the deck.
“ Lend me a handkerchief, Blake,” he whispered. “ We must gag him or he’ll rouse the ship. Quick! there’s not a moment to lose.”
To tie the prostrate man’s hands and to stuff a handkerchief into his mouth was the work of only a few minutes. When this was done, Tomkins lay like a log upon the deck, powerless to hinder or to injure them.
“ Come, Blake,” said Dudley, hurriedly. “ I am afraid this will alter our plans. That fellow has evidently been watching us for some time. He has recognized you, and will give you away to the skipper as soon as they find him. What are you going to do?”

The cook stood irresolute. “I don’t know,” he answered feebly. “ It seems to me I’m done for.”
“Then come with us,” Dudley returned. “ You’ve been a good friend to us hitherto, and I give you my word if you throw in your lot with us, you shall never regret it Your future shall be my care. What do you say ? ”
“ I am with you,” said the cook, with an alacrity that took Dudley by surprise. “If you’ll have me, Til come, and be damned to Lampion and the crowd of them.”
“ Overboard, then,” cried the other; and the next moment the cook had seized the rope, and was lowering himself into the boat below. Dudley followed his example, between them they unhitched the patent clips by which it was held, and before they could have counted twenty, she had dropped behind the steamer, and was pitching and tossing in the boiling wake.

CHAPTER XI
Some minutes elapsed before any one in the boat spoke. They sat just as they had taken their places —Miss Erskine in the stern, Dudley amidships, and Blake in the bows, watching the ship draw further and further from them. For the moment it seemed impossible to believe that they were free. Then suddenly Miss Erskine buried her face in her hands, and, as she confessed afterwards, became a prey to the most agonizing thoughts. Strange though it may appear, she had never until that moment properly realized the extent of her uncle’s villainy. Now in this first flush of freedom it all seemed to come home to her, and the burden was more than she could bear. “My mother! my poor mother!” Dudley heard her say to herself, and with each repetition a sob burst from her. Blake did not utter a word. The suddenness of the whole proceeding, the change from the monotonous regularity of ship life to that of wild outlawdom, had taken him so much by surprise that it deprived him of speech. As he has said since “ he was that flustered that for a few minutes he didn’t know whether he was on 167

board the ship or in the boat.” It was Dudley who recalled his friends to the reality of the moment
“ Give me a hand, Blake, will you ? ” he cried. “We must step that mast and get sail on her at once. The steamer may discover our absence at any moment, and as soon as she does it’s a hundred pounds to a halfpenny that she will put back in search of us.”
So saying, he lifted the mast, and, with the cook’s assistance, set it in the socket Sail was presently set, and the small craft, with Dudley at the tiller, was soon ploughing away before a fair breeze, on an almost due westerly course. Already the steamer was a dim speck under the clouds, and in less time than it takes to tell, she had disappeared from view altogether. Dudley threw a glance over his shoulder and convinced himself of this fact, and when he had done so turned to the girl beside him.
“ Can you realize that you are free, Miss Erskine ? ” he said.
“ Free ? ” she repeated very softly. Then, taking his hand impulsively, she cried, “Yes, thank God, I am free, and it is to you I owe my liberty. But for you I should not be here. Oh, Mr. Dudley, how can I thank you ? How can I show you the gratitude I feel?”
She looked up into his face, and by the light of the moon, which at that moment was sailing between the fast-driving clouds, he saw that tears were streaming down her cheeks. Her condition bordered upon hysteria.

“My dear Miss Erskine,” he said, “you must not give way. However sad your condition may have been, it is at an end now. Your uncle was a villain, but fortunately we have been able to save him from the sin he contemplated. He at least should be thankful to us for that Now let us discuss our position. All being well, we shall make our way to the coast, which I estimate is about a hundred miles distant; reach the Island of Lamu, and thence proceed by mail-boat to Zanzibar, where it will be possible for us to return to Cape Town or to follow any other route we please. So you see you have no reason to feel sad about your position. It has improved a thousand-fold within the last hour.*’
“ I am not thinking of that,” she said. “ I am overcome by the gratitude I feel for my escape. If God had not sent you to my assistance, Mr. Dudley, I should in all probability have been dead by this time. If you will be patient with me for a few minutes I will promise you soon to be all right again.”
In order to give her time to recover herself, Dudley addressed a question to Blake, asking him whether he could discern any sign of the steamer.
“ She has gone clean out of sight, sir,” the man replied. “ I thought I spotted her a few minutes ago, but since then she has disappeared entirely. Let her go; we don’t want to see any more of her.”
A long pause ensued, during which Dudley occupied himself with the management of the
169

boat He could understand how both his friends would be likely to feel. Blake had befriended him against his own interests, as had been proved, with the result that he was now, not only an outcast on the ocean, but a deserter of his ship, likely to lose all he had in the world, and to become amenable to the criminal code besides. Miss Erskine was somewhat differently situated. She had been saved from a cruel death and was on her way to freedom once more. Still, she was ill and very weak ; while the shock she had received was certain to render her a prey to the gloomiest thoughts for some time to come. However, Dudley knew it would not do to allow them to brood upon their troubles, so, to furnish them with something else to think about, he bade the cook open the box of provisions and see what he could find for supper.
“You don’t happen, by any chance, to have included a bottle of wine or spirits in our picnic basket, do you ? ” he inquired in a jocular tone.
“There’s a bottle of brandy,’’ the man replied. “I’m glad now that I thought of it I will.pass it aft to you, sir. A little drop would do the young lady good, if I’m not mistaken.’’
At first Miss Erskine declared that she would not touch it, but Dudley insisted, and at last prevailed upon her to do so. Giving her the tiller to hold for a moment, with a laughing injunction to keep her head pointed straight for England and happiness, he proceeded to pour a small portion of the spirit into the glass with which the cook had no

furnished him. Then, when it had been filled with water from the beaker, he presented it to her, inviting her to drink to a successful voyage.
“ Have you another tumbler there, cook ? ” he inquired.
“Yes; I put in one for each of you, sir.”
“Then pour out a glass of grog for yourself, my man, and help Miss Erskine to drink the toast. We ought to think ourselves lucky to have got off so cheaply. We’ve a smart little hooker under us, and if the breeze holds, as I fancy it will, we ought to sight the coast in something like fourteen or fifteen hours. Have you a watch upon you ? ”
“Yes, sir,” the man answered. “ I make the time twenty minutes past one.”
“In that case,” put in Miss Erskine, who had been listening attentively, “we should be on land between three and four o’clock this afternoon. Oh, what a relief it will be 1 ”
“And what part of the coast might it be that you reckon we’re alongside of now, Mr. Dudley ? " the cook inquired, as he produced a tin of beef from the box, and, holding it between his knees, proceeded to open it
“ It is difficult to say,” the other returned; “ that is, of course with any hope of being accurate. I had only time to steal a glance at the chart the other day, but I should say we should be somewhere between Kwyhu Island and Formosa Bay. That is mere supposition on my part, but I feel sure it cannot be very far from the mark. In either case it should not

be a very difficult matter for us to make Lamu, even if some boat does not pick us up before.”
* That would be the best thing that could befall us, I think,” said Miss Erskine. “ Let us hope that when day dawns a vessel will be in sight”
By this time the cook had opened the tin of meat and had prepared two portions. Dudley noticed that he did not take any himself. He accordingly questioned him on the subject
“ Oh, that’s all right, sir,” he answered. ” Don’t you trouble about me. Fil have something myself when yob have finished.”
“ Nonsense! ” retorted Dudley; “ you’ll have it now. Take some at once. Neither Miss Erskine nor I will eat anything if you do not”
Blake accordingly consented, and a few minutes later they were all busily engaged, Dudley feeding himself with one hand, the other being engaged with the tiller. And, indeed, the boat required some watching. The breeze had freshened considerably, and in consequence a fair sea was running. When they had finished their meal—and it was not very much that Miss Erskine could be prevailed upon to eat—Dudley unfastened the roll of shawls she had brought with her, and wrapped one about her.
“ Are you quite sure that you do not feel cold ? ” he asked.
“Not in the least,” she answered. “I am very comfortable and happy now. You cannot guess what a weight has been taken off my mind, and

I think perhaps the happiest part of it is the knowledge that my wretched uncle was saved from committing the sin he intended.”
“ And that reminds me of a question I wished to ask you,” Dudley continued. “ Did your uncle pay your cabin a visit ten minutes or so before you left it?”
“Yes,” she replied. “That was why I did not come up at once. He came in about nine o’clock and said he would return at midnight You may imagine my consternation, for I knew you would be waiting for me, and would be anxious when I did not make my appearance on deck. As long as I live I shall remember the fright I had when he entered the cabin and leant over my bunk. He had brought some medicine with him, and he intended that I should take it To my horror I discovered that he was intoxicated. When, therefore, he told me to drink it, I begged him not to make me, informing him that I felt so ill that I was sure it would kill me outright He answered that I must have it, as it would do me good; and when I still declined, he tried to force it upon me. In the struggle that ensued, it was spilt in the bunk, whereupon he declared that he would mix some more, and that I should take it in the morning whether I liked it or not”
“The brute I” said Dudley, viciously. “ I’d liked to have been behind him at the moment However, his prophecy is not destined to be fulfilled. When he enters your cabin to carry out his threat, he will 173

discover that his bird has flown. By the way, Blake, were those letters left in your cabin, or did you bring them with you ? ”
st They’re lying on the chest of drawers beside my bunk, sir,” the man replied. “Just where you put them. They’ll find them for certain when they go in to look for me.”
Here he laughed sardonically.
“ What is it that is causing you so much amusement ? ” Dudley inquired, for he felt sure there must be some joke to account for the other’s good humour.
“I was thinking, sir, that that vessel won’t be what you might call a bed of roses, so to speak, for the rest of the voyage—at any rate, not until she reaches Aden. I’ve just remembered that there’s only my mate to cook for the whole ship’s company, and he knows as much about it as that tiller in your hand, sir. They won’t wish me back again! Oh no, of course not! ”
He chuckled again at the hugeness of his joke. He could picture the discomfort occasioned aft by his absence, and he could almost hear the imprecations that would greet his name forrard.
“ I always did say,” he went on, “ that my mate would get himself into trouble sooner or later for not knowing his business. Well, he’s gone and done it now, or I’m much mistaken.”
“ I’m afraid the prospect, as far as he is concerned, is not a very happy one,” Dudley remarked ; and then turning to Miss Erskine, he inquired whether she felt

sleepy. “ I think, if you will let us, we could make you a fairly comfortable bed at the bottom of the boat,” he said. “Just see what you can do, will you, Blake?”
Miss Erskine protested that she was very comfortable in her present position; but Dudley had made up his mind, and he and Blake between them accordingly constructed a resting-place for her on the floor.
“ You are very good to me,” began the girl, as she laid herself down on the couch they had improvised for her. “ I only wish I could be of some assistance to you.”
“ So you can,” Dudley replied, * by continuing to bear this little temporary inconvenience as cheerfully as you are now doing. Some day you will laugh when you think of it.”
“ I’m afraid not,” she answered ; and Dudley saw that he had made a mistake.
Feeling that his unfortunate remark might occasion a return of her sadness, he spoke of the mail service from Lamu to Zanzibar, and then wished her good night, promising to call her as soon as it was light.
“ Make yourself as comfortable as you can forrard there, Blake,” he continued; “ and if by any chance you should sight a vessel, let me know at once, will you ? ”
“Ay, ay, sir,” the cook replied. “But watch and watch about is only fair play. Why won’t you take a bit of a rest, sir, and let me have the tiller for a while? ”

“You may be sure I will when I feel tired,” Dudley answered. “In the mean time you had better get off to sleep if you can. Good night, and many thanks to you for the brave and generous part you have played in this affair.”
“Don’t mention it, sir,” the man returned ; “ I’m glad now that I came.”
From that moment, so to speak, Dudley had the boat to himself. He sat in the stern-sheets, tiller in hand, steering always for a certain star, and dodging the seas which were now running with considerable velocity. Heavy clouds still held possession of the sky, but there were not wanting signs which showed that they would soon draw off and the moon shine out again. This had but one meaning, namely, that there was more wind behind ; and when he saw this, Dudley could not repress a feeling of uneasiness.
“Let us hope it doesn’t rise until we are safe ashore,” he said to himself. “ This sea is quite heavy enough as it is. The boat rides very well, but I’m not quite sure that if they grow any bigger she won’t run the risk of being swamped.”
From the consideration of the safety of his craft, Dudley’s thoughts passed to other matters. From where he sat he could catch a glimpse of Miss Erskine’s profile, as her head lay upon the pillow he had improvised for her. And as he watched her he thought of all she had passed through since she had left Cape Town, and of the terrible shock the discoveries she had made must have been to a girl so delicately nurtured. He carried his mind back to

the evening when he had first made her acquaintance at Government House, and it was with a sensible shock that he recalled the fate his palmist partner had foretold after reading his hand. M You will fall in love with a tall woman,” she had said—"a woman with a beautiful face and fair hair. She will return your affections, but your love-making will be far from smooth. You will part soon after you first meet, and you will find each other in a place that is far away. You will come very near losing your life, but you will not do so.”
As he thought of this he remembered his sudden infatuation for the girl whose safety was now his one and only care. It was certainly correct that they had parted soon after their first meeting, and it was equally true that they had found each other in a place that was far away. Was this only a freak of chance, or had the prophecy been the genuine outcome of inspiration ? It looked very like the latter. Of one thing, at any rate, there could be no sort of doubt; so far as Dudley was concerned, there was but one woman in the world, and she was sleeping peacefully at his feet It was for her sake that he had risked so much, for her sake that they were where they now were. So far fortune had rewarded his efforts, but what was the end to be ? He would have given something to have been able to see that.
When he had been at the helm something like an hour, he leant forward and looked at Miss Erskine again. To his delight, she was sleeping as peacefully a§ before; and, since he had not seen Blake’s head

rise above the gunwale for a considerable time, he could only suppose that he too was in the Blessed Land of Forgetfulness. Feeling that it was better that he should be allowed to slumber, he remained at his post without waking the man, and it was not until the first signs of dawn were in the sky that either of them roused. Then it was the cook who lifted his head and looked at Dudley with a sleepy face. He was about to rise and make his way aft, but the other stopped him. Shaking his head, he pointed to the girl at his feet, and so gave the man to understand that if he moved it would only have the effect of waking her. He nodded cheerfully, to allow Blake to see that he was in no way fatigued by his long watch, and then settled down again to keep the boat’s head fixed in the proper direction. Little by little the daylight crept into the sky—a wild, cheerless dawn, that offered few prospects of a fine day. The wind had fallen somewhat, but the sea was still running higher than Dudley liked. One moment they were perched on the crest of a wave, with a wide horizon opening around them; the next they were down in a deep green trough, a watery ascent before them, and half an acre of boiling foam behind them. Dudley found that all his seamanship was required to prevent the boat from being swamped. Several times sharp dashes of spray, blown by the wind from the crest of swift-flowing waves, rattled upon them like so much hail, and more than once they were carried down a swift decline upon a bank of water that ran level with the tiller-head.

A Sailor’s Bride breakfasted with difficulty at six o'clock, and at nine Dudley announced that, at a rough guess, half their voyage was accomplished. Miss Erskine, despite the inconvenience to which she was subjected, seemed better for her night’s rest. She ate her breakfast with an appetite that had been sadly wanting before, and altogether looked more like her old self. When the meal was at an end Dudley called the cook aft.
M Do you think you can take the tiller,” he said, (t while I go forward and try to obtain a little rest ? Keep her as she is going, and be careful to watch the seas. You will find that they require all your attention.”
“No, Mr. Dudley,” Miss Erskine put in with determination; “I cannot agree to your going forward. Here at least is something I can do for you. You shall rest in comfort at the bottom of the boat, while I keep a look-out No; please do not prevent me. Let me at least have the satisfaction of doing something to help you.”
Realizing that it would probably afford her pleasure to be of some assistance, Dudley allowed her to do as she wished, and as soon as he had seen her safely seated in the bows, and had given the cook instructions to call him should there be any change in the weather, or should any vessel heave in sight, he laid himself down upon the rugs upon which Miss Erskine had slept the previous night, and in less time than it takes to tell, was fast asleep.

board the ship or in the boat.” It was Dudley who recalled his friends to the reality of the moment
“ Give me a hand, Blake, will you ? ” he cried. “We must step that mast and get sail on her at once. The steamer may discover our absence at any moment, and as soon as she does it’s a hundred pounds to a halfpenny that she will put back in search of us.”
So saying, he lifted the mast, and, with the cook’s assistance, set it in the socket Sail was presently set, and the small craft, with Dudley at the tiller, was soon ploughing away before a fair breeze, on an almost due westerly course. Already the steamer was a dim speck under the clouds, and in less time than it takes to tell, she had disappeared from view altogether. Dudley threw a glance over his shoulder and convinced himself of this fact, and when he had done so turned to the girl beside him.
“ Can you realize that you are free, Miss Erskine ? ” he said.
“ Free ? ” she repeated very softly. Then, taking his hand impulsively, she cried, “Yes, thank God, I am free, and it is to you I owe my liberty. But for you I should not be here. Oh, Mr. Dudley, how can I thank you ? How can I show you the gratitude I feel?”
She looked up into his face, and by the light of the moon, which at that moment was sailing between the fast-driving clouds, he saw that tears were streaming down her cheeks. Her condition bordered upon hysteria.

"My dear Miss Erskine,” he said, "you must not give way. However sad your condition may have been, it is at an end now. Your uncle was a villain, but fortunately we have been able to save him from the sin he contemplated. He at least should be thankful to us for that Now let us discuss our position. All being well, we shall make our way to the coast, which I estimate is about a hundred miles distant; reach the Island of Lamu, and thence proceed by mail-boat to Zanzibar, where it will be possible for us to return to Cape Town or to follow any other route we please. So you see you have no reason to feel sad about your position. It has improved a thousand-fold within the last hour.”
" I am not thinking of that,” she said. " I am overcome by the gratitude I feel for my escape. If God had not sent you to my assistance, Mr. Dudley, I should in all probability have been dead by this time. If you will be patient with me for a few minutes I will promise you soon to be all right again.”
In order to give her time to recover herself, Dudley addressed a question to Blake, asking him whether he could discern any sign of the steamer.
" She has gone clean out of sight, sir,” the man replied. " I thought I spotted her a few minutes ago, but since then she has disappeared entirely. Let her go; we don’t want to see any more of her.”
A long pause ensued, during which Dudley occupied himself with the management of the 169

boat He could understand how both his friends would be likely to feel. Blake had befriended him against his own interests, as had been proved, with the result that he was now, not only an outcast on the ocean, but a deserter of his ship, likely to lose all he had in the world, and to become amenable to the criminal code besides. Miss Erskine was somewhat differently situated. She had been saved from a cruel death and was on her way to freedom once more. Still, she was ill and very weak ; while the shock she had received was certain to render her a prey to the gloomiest thoughts for some time to come. However, Dudley knew it would not do to allow them to brood upon their troubles, so, to furnish them with something else to think about, he bade the cook open the box of provisions and see what he could find for supper.
“You don’t happen, by any chance, to have included a bottle of wine or spirits in our picnic basket, do you ? ” he inquired in a jocular tone.
“There’s a bottle of brandy,” the man replied. “I’m glad now that I thought of it I will.pass it aft to you, sir. A little drop would do the young lady good, if I’m not mistaken.”
At first Miss Erskine declared that she would not touch it, but Dudley insisted, and at last prevailed upon her to do so. Giving her the tiller to hold for a moment, with a laughing injunction to keep her head pointed straight for England and happiness, he proceeded to pour a small portion of the spirit into the glass with which the cook had

furnished him. Then, when it had been filled with water from the beaker, he presented it to her, inviting her to drink to a successful voyage.
“Have you another tumbler there, cook?” he inquired.
“ Yes; I put in one for each of you, sir.”
“Then pour out a glass of grog for yourself, my man, and help Miss Erskine to drink the toast. We ought to think ourselves lucky to have got off so cheaply. We’ve a smart little hooker under us, and if the breeze holds, as I fancy it will, we ought to sight the coast in something like fourteen or fifteen hours. Have you a watch upon you ? ”
“Yes, sir,” the man answered. “ I make the time twenty minutes past one.”
“In that case,” put in Miss Erskine, who had been listening attentively, “we should be on land between three and four o’clock this afternoon. Oh, what a relief it will be! ”
“And what part of the coast might it be that you reckon we’re alongside of now, Mr. Dudley ? ’’ the cook inquired, as he produced a tin of beef from the box, and, holding it between his knees, proceeded to open it
“ It is difficult to say,” the other returned; “ that is, of course, with any hope of being accurate. I had only time to steal a glance at the chart the other day, but I should say we should be somewhere between Kwyhu Island and Formosa Bay. That is mere supposition on my part, but I feel sure it cannot be very far from the mark. In either case it should not

be a very difficult matter for us to make Lamu, even if some boat does not pick us up before."
“ That would be the best thing that could befall us, I think,” said Miss Erskine. “ Let us hope that when day dawns a vessel will be in sight”
By this time the cook had opened the tin of meat and had prepared two portions. Dudley noticed that he did not take any himself. He accordingly questioned him on the subject
“ Oh, that's all right, sir,” he answered. “ Don’t you trouble about me. I’ll have something myself when yoU have finished.”
“Nonsense I "retorted Dudley; “you’ll have it now. Take some at once. Neither Miss Erskine nor I will eat anything if you do not” .
Blake accordingly consented, and a few minutes later they were all busily engaged, Dudley feeding himself with one hand, the other being engaged with the tiller. And, indeed, the boat required some watching. The breeze had freshened considerably, and in consequence a fair, sea was running. When they had finished their meal—and it was not very much that Miss Erskine could be prevailed upon to eat—Dudley unfastened the roll of shawls she had brought with her, and wrapped one about her.
“Are you quite sure that you do not feel cold?” he asked.
“ Not in the least,” she answered. “ I am very comfortable and happy now. You cannot guess what a weight has been taken off my mind, and

“ And that reminds me of a question I wished to ask you,” Dudley continued. “ Did your uncle pay your cabin a visit ten minutes or so before you left it?”

Here he laughed sardonically.

breakfasted with difficulty at six o'clock, and at nine Dudley announced that, at a rough guess, half their voyage was accomplished.

She ate her breakfast with an appetite that had been sadly wanting before, and altogether looked more like her old self. When the meal was at an end Dudley called the cook aft.

out The anxiety of the last few days, and all that had befallen him the night before, taken in conjunction with his long vigil at the helm, had combined to wear him out, and in consequence, when he did fall asleep, it was to enjoy a rest such as he had been a stranger to for some time past He seemed scarcely to have been sleeping more than a few minutes, however, when he was awakened by feeling his shoulder violently shaken. He looked up, half asleep and half awake, to find the boat still careering across the open seas, and a large steamer of between three and four thousand tons heading directly towards them. She was barely a cable’s length away when he looked —so close, indeed, that he could read the name upon her bows, United Italy.
“ Good Heavens I if you’re not careful she’ll run us down I ” he cried, springing to his feet and clambering aft beside Blake. Seizing the tiller, he put it over, and the next minute the steamer had passed them at a distance of fifty yards or so, and they were tumbling and tossing in her wake.
“ She’ll heave-to and pick us up in a few moments,” Dudley began, as he put the boat on her course again, for he dared not attempt to bring her to.
His prophecy was not destined to be fulfilled, however; for the vessel held on her way, and was presently only a speck in the distance.
“They couldn’t have realized our condition,” continued Dudley, for the sake of the others suppressing the bitter anger that rose in his heart 180

41 However, we mustn’t lose heart We cannot be more than thirty miles from the coast now.”
Neither Miss Erskine nor Blake offered any reply to this speech, and the boat still went on her way, rising and falling, pitching and tossing, towards the west. By midday the sea had somewhat abated, and the waves, which had hitherto been so boisterous, had given place to a long and uncomfortable swell. Before many hours were over now, they should be in a position to catch their first glimpse of land, and they would then know how Fate had treated them. It was just possible, as Dudley pointed out, that, if they struck Lamu, they might be lucky enough to hit the arrival of the Deutsche Ost Afrika’s boat for Mombasa, and thus be able to get on to Zanzibar without loss of time. If not, it would be necessary for them to wait patiently until she did put in an appearance.
“Get out lunch, Blake,” said Dudley. “Let us hope it will be our last meal in the boat. I can assure you I shall not be sorry to stretch my legs ashore.”
In spite of their’indignation at the treatment they had received from the steamer, they made an excellent meal, and Dudley noticed with delight that Miss Erskine’s appetite was slowly coming back to her. What was more, a faint tinge of colour was making its appearance in her hitherto haggard cheeks. After lunch he persuaded her to lie down and rest again, but it was sorely against her will.
“ You will promise to call me directly land is in sight, will you not?” she stipulated. “After all that 181

has happened lately, you may imagine how anxious I am to catch a glimpse of it”
“You shall be called at once,” Dudley answered ; “ but I don’t somehow fancy we shall see anything of it for some considerable time to come. We are not making the progress we were doing a few hours ago.”
As a matter of fact, the wind dropped to the faintest zephyr about three o’clock, and in consequence it was well-nigh five before Blake, who had been on the look-out in the bows, reported that he could discern what looked like land ahead. Five minutes later it had grown plainer, and lay, like a long faint smudge upon the horizon.
“How far do you think we are from it?” Miss Erskine inquired, clutching Dudley’s arm in her excitement, and speaking with an eagerness that she did not attempt to conceal.
* Probably about five miles,” the other replied. “ Certainly not more. I should like to know what land it is before I venture near it. However, beggars can’t be choosers, and I have no doubt that if it is not Lamu we shall soon be able to get there. So we’ll try it at any rate.”
Very slowly, too slowly for her passengers, who were watching it with straining eyes, the boat approached the land. So far as they could see, it appeared to be densely wooded, and rose gradually from the beach towards the centre. Away to the starboard the sea was breaking heavily on shoals and reefs, but the course Dudley was steering at the 182

moment seemed, so far as he could judge, a safe one.
“ Keep a good look-out ahead, Blake! ” he cried. “ We mustn’t trust this coast too far. Let me know at once if you see anything suspicious.”
“Ay, ay, sir,” the cook replied, and, kneeling in the bows, a hand on either gunwale, he stared steadfastly ahead.
By this time every detail of the shore could be plainly distinguished. The island, whatever its name might be, was a fair-sized one, possibly from fifteen to twenty miles long. Not a vestige of a village, however, could be seen, only a dense mass of mangroves on the shore, and of cocoa-nut trees on the higher land. At last, after innumerable twistings and turnings to avoid rocks and shoals, they reached the beach, and ran the boat ashore. It was not an inviting spot, but it was at least terra finna, and as such was felt by all hands to be superior to the steamer or the boat They disembarked, and then Dudley and Blake pulled the boat up out of harm’s way. Having done this, they rejoined Miss Erskine. Taking Dudley’s hand in hers, she looked up at him.
“ Let us thank God, Mr. Dudley, most earnestly,” she said, “ for having brought us so safely to land.”

“Well,” said Dudley, “we have reached land at last The next question for us to decide is what to do now that we are here. From what we can see of our surroundings, they do not appear to be very hospitable. We may, however, discover a better place when we proceed further inland. It seems to me that the most advisable thing to do is to have a meal first for we have eaten nothing since this morning, and then set off in search of a village. There must surely be one somewhere at hand. What do you think?”
His companions agreed that, all things considered, this course would be the best and they accordingly obtained the provisions from the boat, and, sitting down under a palm tree, commenced their meal. It was certainly a happier repast than that which they had eaten shortly after leaving the steamer. Still, their position was sufficiently precarious to cause them no little anxiety as to the future.
“ If only I can discover the name of the island, and its distance from Lamu, I shall not mind so very much,” muttered Dudley to himself, after he had given the matter some thought. “Until I can do 184

that, we are like children lost in a wood ; we cannot tell where we are, or in which direction we should proceed.”
As soon as they had finished their meal, he called a council of war, and the question was argued as to whether it would be safer to leave the boat where she was, while they went in search of a village, or whether they should pull round the coast in her in the hope of discovering some sign of human habitations.
“ It seems to me we shall have to chance it, sir,” said Blake. “ If we decide to leave her, and you and Miss Erskine go off in search of a town, and the niggers come down and find her here and me in charge alone, I shouldn’t very well be able to prevent them from collaring her, should I ? While if you get into trouble inland, I fancy you would find it useful to have me alongside of you. Every one helps, you know, sir, when it' comes to rough - and - tumble fighting.”
“ I agree with you there,” Dudley answered. “ Loth as I am to do so, I am afraid there is nothing for it but to leave the boat here and to trust to chance and the honesty of the inhabitants not to steal her, or to do her any harm during our absence. What remains of the provisions I think we had better carry away with us for safety’s sake, and, above all, let us take the brandy. The island does not look a particularly healthy place from what I can see of it, and if there is fever hanging about, we shall find the spirit worth its weight in gold. Before we start, in case of accident, I will load the revolver you gave i»5

me, Blake. There is nothing like taking precautions. We may count it a fortunate circumstance that we brought it with us.”
* That’s just what I said to you, sir, when I wanted you to take it, do you remember ? ” the man replied, evidently delighted that his prophecy had turned out a true;one. “‘Forewarned is forearmed/ they do say, but give me a trigger with six cartridges to work upon for my money.”
° I only hope you won’t have to use it,” said Miss Erskine to Dudley. " Let us pray that there maybe no fighting. I am quite ready to start when you give the word.”
w In that case I think we had better be off.”
Giving Blake Miss Erskine’s rug to carry, and himself taking what remained of their store of food, Dudley gave the signal, and they accordingly left the little beach on which they had landed, and entered the thicker scrub behind. As they were destined soon to discover, it was by no means easy walking. On the beach itself the mangroves grew so close together that it was a difficult and, in some cases, an almost impossible task to make one’s way through them. When they reached the higher ground, however, and found themselves among the palms, they were able to make better progress. So far they had discovered no signs of any native village, nor of any path which looked as if it would lead to one. This afforded Dudley food for serious reflection. Had they stumbled upon an uninhabited island ? or were the villages upon the farther side ? He was still pondering this question 186

in his own mind, when a cry from Miss Erskine attracted his attention. She had been walking a few paces ahead, but had now stopped, and was pointing to the ground.
“ See, here is a path,” she cried, with a note of triumph in her voice. “ It must have been made by human feet, and it is only logical to suppose that it must lead somewhere.”
“Let us follow it and find out,” Dudley answered. “ I am afraid, however, it is some time since it has been used. Do you notice the grass that has grown in the middle ? If it were in daily use, that would scarcely be.”
“ If it only takes us to a place where we can camp for the night, it is better than nothing, sir, is it not ? ” inquired Blake, with an earnest face. “ It will very soon be dark now: there are clouds coming up, and it may rain. In that case even a deserted hut would be better than nothing at all.”
“I agree with you,” Dudley returned. “Let us push on and see whither it takes us.”
They accordingly followed the track over the shoulder of the hill, and across a plateau in a southwesterly direction. The sun by this time was low in the west; long shafts of light filtered in through the palms and fell upon the path. Other than their own footsteps, however, not a sound was to be heard.
Suddenly Dudley stopped and pointed ahead.
“What is that I can see through the trees?” he asked, shading his eyes with his hand.

"It looks like a house,” answered Miss Erskine “—a house with white walls. And if I am not mistaken, this path leads directly to it”
“ In that case,” said the cook, “ it won’t be long before we can settle the question of a village for ourselves."
They quickened their pace, and in a few minutes were close enough to the object in question, to see that it was all that remained of an Arab dwelling. It was constructed of dried mud and coral, and had once been whitewashed. The roof had fallen in, and so had one of the walls, but the remainder of the structure was still standing. In the evening light, and in the silence of the palm grove, the effect produced was almost ghostly.
“I am afraid this place is not likely to be of very much service to us,” remarked Dudley, as he surveyed it with evident disapproval. “With the roof off and one of the walls missing, we might just as well camp in the open, possibly a great deal better, if there is wind about Are those houses down there ? ”
He pointed down a somewhat steep declivity to where a few other white objects could be seen in the gathering gloom.
“ Possibly we may be more fortunate if we descend to them.”
“ Let us do so by all means, then,” replied Miss Erskine. “ We must not postpone our search too long, or night will fall before we have arranged where we are to sleep.”

They accordingly descended the hill, and approached the cluster of buildings they could see among the trees at the bottom. As it turned out they were all that remained of an Arab village, of which the house on the hill was undoubtedly the largest For some reason these buildings were in a better state of preservation than that on the hill, but even then they were none too good. In one, the first they encountered, the roof still stood; but Dudley, who had explored the interior, was compelled to confess that it did not look inviting. Still, it was a house, and the best they could find. They had, therefore, to make the most of it
“I am afraid we shall not do better,” he said ruefully, as he reported its condition to his friends. “ Do you think you would be afraid to trust yourself inside it for the night, Miss Erskine ? ”
As he said this he glanced at the beautiful girl before him, and thought what a miserable place it was for her to spend the hours of darkness in.
“ I am not afraid to trust myself anywhere if you are with me,” she returned, simply, looking at him as she spoke. Then, realizing the construction that might be placed upon her words, she made an excuse and fied into the house, as if to hide her face.
Dudley stood looking after her almost dumbfounded. He could scarcely believe that he had heard aright But if he had, what glorious possibilities her words conjured up! Great, indeed, is the magic of a young woman’s tongue upon a man who loves her. For a moment the whole scene was trans-

formed. The tumble-down miserable hovel before him became almost palatial in its grandeur, and the whole earth seemed to ring with celestial music. He was in the clouds; but he was to be brought to earth with startling rapidity.
“ I fancy when all is said and done, that this one’s about the best of them, sir,” said Blake, who had been exploring the other houses. “That’s not saying very much. Talk about beetles, if there’s not one of every kind to be found in them old shanties, I don’t know a cockroach from a centipede. It’s like the Plagues of Egypt. The houses must have been deserted for years.”
“Very likely,” Dudley answered. “Still, such as they are, we must make the best of them. Do you think you could manage to find your way back to the boat and bring up the sail ? With it we might possibly be able to rig up some sort of a hammock for Miss Erskine. I don’t like the notion of her sleeping upon the floor.”
“I’ll go at once, sir,” the willing fellow replied. “I can find my way there and back as easily as falling off a log. I’ll hurry up and have the sail here before you can look round.”
Without more ado he set off, and the last Dudley saw of him he was waving his hand at the top of the hill by the house they had inspected a quarter of an hour or so before. Then he turned and went into the building in search of Miss Erskine. On second inspection its squalor seemed to have increased rather than diminished. Such light as

entered through the broken wall served only to bring its innumerable imperfections more prominently before their eyes. Boughs of trees, withered palmleaves, filth, rags, and—strange waif of luxury—an empty Pomeroy and Greno’s champagne-case, littered the floor.
"As I said just now, it’s a terrible place in which to ask you to spend the night, Miss Erskine,” said Dudley; “ but I am afraid it’s the best we can offer you. Blake has explored the other houses, and reports that they are all equally bad. It’s just possible that we may be able to clean it up a little before you come in. Then if we can turn the sail of the boat into some sort of hammock, you will at least be kept from actual contact with the floor. I think, if you don’t mind going outside, I will commence my housemaid’s duties at once.”
"I am not going outside,” she answered, with determination. " And I am not going to let you put yourself to the trouble of cleaning it”
“ But I have set my heart upon doing so.”
“ Then I shall stay and help you.”
“ You will do nothing of the kind,” he retorted, with equal firmness. “ If you desire to help me, you will do as I ask. Please go, in order that I may have it ready by the time Blake returns. We are only wasting time in argument.”
“ You are very obstinate. Do you really wish me to leave you ? ”

“ In that case I will go,” she rejoined. * But it makes me feel even more selfish than before. You do everything for me, but you never let me do one little thing in return to help you. It is not fair.”
With this parting shot she left the hut The sun had disappeared, and a soft breeze was ruffling the palms above the house. Armed with a large stick, which he used partly as a rake, and partly as a broom, Dudley commenced his task. It proved a bigger one than he had expected. But in something like a quarter of an hour it was comparatively finished ; that is to say, sufficient filth had been dragged and pushed outside to bring the place within a day’s march of cleanliness. More could not be done.
When he had finished, he rejoined Miss Erskine.
“ I fancy it’s a good thing for me,” he said, with an attempt at laughter, “that the dye has not altogether departed from my skin, otherwise I should look disgracefully dirty. I wonder where Blake is ? He ought to be back by this time.”
But minute after minute went by and still the man did not put in an appearance. When upwards of three quarters of an hour had elapsed and darkness had fallen, Dudley began to grow anxious.
“ Can he have lost his way ? ” he reflected. “And yet it was not a very difficult path to find. We came almost straight up from the beach, and it runs, or appears to run, diagonally across the island. He would be almost certain to hit it I wish now that I had not let him go.”

“You should reproach me for it,” said Miss Erskine. “ It was your kind thought for my comfort that made you send him.”
“That was not my meaning at all,” the other answered. “ I was thinking that, instead of despatching him, I should have gone myself.”
“In that case you can understand what my feelings would be now,” said the girl, “ if, like Blake, you did not return.”
An answer to this speech was on the tip of Dudley’s tongue, but he forced it back. The present, he compelled himself to see, was no time for lovemaking. Ten minutes more went by, and still there was no sign of Blake. Dudley was nearly beside himself with anxiety. He did not know what he should do if the man did not come soon. If he had fallen into the hands of the natives, or Arabs, he must be rescued ; but how was Dudley to do this with Miss Erskine in his charge? He could not leave her if there was the remotest chance of trouble, nor could he take her with him. It was so dark by this time that they could scarcely have seen the man even had he put in an appearance on the hill. All they could do was to wait patiently and to conjecture as to what was detaining him. At last the sound of footsteps greeted their ears. Dudley, who had been seated on a fallen tree, sprang to his feet.
“ Thank goodness,” he cried, “ he is safe after all 1 ” “Are you quite sure that it is Blake?” Miss Erskine inquired anxiously. “Might it not be a native?”

“ Impossible,” answered Dudley. “ That man is wearing boots.”
The words were barely out of his mouth before the cook dashed out of the darkness and came to a standstill before them.
“ Good heavens, Blake I ” Dudley began almost angrily. “ Where have you been ? You don’t know how anxious we have felt about you! What has detained you ? ”
“ I lost my way,” the cook replied humbly, after a moment’s consideration. “I knew you would be anxious, sir.”
“Anxious 1” Dudley rejoined. “I should just think we have been. I have been imagining all sorts of things. Couldn’t you find the boat ? I see you haven’t brought the sail.”
“ No, sir, I couldn’t find her,” the man answered, but not in a very confident voice. Then, managing to edge round to Dudley’s side, without Miss Erskine’s observing his action, he touched him on the arm, and made a sign to him that he had something of importance to report Dudley took in the situation at a glance.
“ I am extremely sorry, Miss Erskine,” he said. “ I fear for to-night we must do what we can for you with your rugs. I will go and spread them out I should have liked to have had the sail, but since we can’t find the boat, we must do without it Such is the fortune of war.”
“ I can do very well without the sail,” she answered promptly. “ I wish you had not taken the trouble to go for it, Blake.”

So saying, she picked up the rugs and went into the hut
“ Now, my lad,” Dudley began, “ for Heaven’s sake speak out and tell me what is the meaning of all this mystery. What kept you away so long, and why did you return without the sail ? You have given me such a fright that I feel as if I shall not get over it for some weeks to come. What is the matter? ”
Before he replied, Blake drew him a little further from the house.
“Come over here, sir,” he said. “Miss Erskine must not hear what I’ve got to say to you. It’s a good deal more important than you think for. You may say you’ve had a fright because I did not come back, but lor’ bless you, sir, it is nothing to the startler that I have had.”
“Get on, get on,” Dudley found strength to ejaculate. “In Heaven’s name, man, get on with your story. What has happened, or what have you discovered ? ”
“It’s just this, sir,” the man returned, drawing closer to him, and dropping his voice to a whisper. “At this moment Doctor Lampion and the Captain are on our track. They’re close upon us now, sir.”
If he had intended to frighten Dudley, he could not have done so more effectively. The latter looked anxiously about him, as if he half expected to see his enemies appear from behind the house, or out of the scrub. Then he seized Blake by the wrist
“ The Captain and Doctor Lampion are following i95

us, do you say ? ” he answered. “ Are you sure of your facts? For God’s sake don’t play with me! You can’t have been drinking, and I don’t believe you can have gone suddenly mad. How, therefore, can you say that they are following us ? ”
“Because I’ve seen the steamer out in the bay, sir; over yonder, not five miles from where we’re standing now,” the cook replied. “ I had just got to the top of the hill, and was running down it towards where we left the boat, when I happened to look out to sea. There I saw a vessel making for the island. She was a steamer, and I knew her as soon as I set eyes upon her. ‘ Goodness sake alive, Bill! ’ says I to myself, ‘ that’s our boat; and what are they here for, if they’re not looking for us ? ’ With that I set to work to figure out what I should da At first I was for coming back to tell you, sir, then I thought I’d stay where I was and watch her. Thinks I to myself, ‘ Blake, my lad, what you’ve got to do is to stay just where you are, and see what her line of action is, so to speak. You’ll be able to tell Mr. Dudley everything, then.’ ”
“ Make haste, make haste,” Dudley continued in a tone of impatience. “Never mind your ‘so to speaks,’ or your ‘ says I to myself.’ Tell me what you saw, and reserve the rest for another time.”
“ Very good, sir,” said the man, quietly. “ I’ll do my best, but I’m not a great speaker, as you know. It’s the want of eddycation, I suppose. But I’ll tell you all I know, and you may take your affeedavee it’s the truth that I’m speaking. ‘Tell the truth,

William,’ my mother used to say to me,1 and you’ll get believed.’ ”
Dudley felt as if he could tear his hair. Try how he would, there seemed to be no way of making the man unburden himself of his narrative quickly and concisely. He felt as if he could have taken him by the shoulders and have shaken him, but he knew in his heart that that would do no good. It would prove quicker in the long run to let him tell his story in his own way.
“Well, sir, as I was saying,” Blake continued, “I looked out to sea, and there I sees the steamer. She was just coming to anchor away there at the other end of the island, and while I watched her I saw that she was lowering a boat * Going ashore to see if you can pick up any information concerning the young lady, are you ? ’ says I to myself. ‘ Don’t you wish you may find her ? ’ For you see, sir, I looks at it in this light myself. Supposing that they send a boat ashore, and that there’s a village at the other side of the island, the folk as live in that village has seen nothing of us, and that being so they can tell no tales. ‘ Have you seen a white man and a lady, and a gent that ain’t neither white nor black, so to speak ? ’ says Lampion to the chief. * No, sir,’ the chief would say to Lampion. ‘ Can’t say like as we have.’ Then the steamer would up anchor and clear out for the next island, and we should be saved.”
Hope revived in Dudley’s breast If, as the cook had said, no one knew of their presence, it was just possible that the steamer might proceed down the i97

coast without pausing to examine the island for herself.
“ Then she has gone ? ” he said. “ Thank goodness, for in that case we need not bother any more about her.”
“That’s just the worst part about it, sir,” said Blake, shaking his head lugubriously. “If she’d gone I shouldn’t have worried about it so much.”
“Then what has she done?” Dudley inquired, a feeling of hopelessness once more stealing over him. “ Why can’t you tell me at once ? Why can’t you give up all this roundabout talk, and tell me straight out what has happened ? ”
“ I thought I was doing so, sir,” the man replied humbly. “ But you confuses of me. Where was I ? Let me think. Oh, I know, the steamer was a-lying there at the end of the island, and she had sent a boat ashore. As I told you just now, I thought as it was all right as long as the natives didn’t know we were ashore. Well, that’s where the worst part of the whole story comes in. What I was going to say was, that I had no sooner made up my mind that we was going to get off scot-free, when I saw a party of niggers a-coming along the beach. They were carrying some basket things upon their heads, and when they saw our boat they stopped and put ’em down just as if they were struck all of a heap. Then they held a bit of talkee-talkee together, and went up and examined her for themselves. I saw ’em lift the oars out, and the mast and sail, and look at them. When they had done that, they had another talk 198

together, and the upshot of it all was they began to pull her down towards the water. I’d have gone and told them to leave her alone, but then, you see, sir, they’d have known we was on the island, and would have blown the gaff to Lampion. The last I saw of them they was a-paddling of her along the shore, just in the very direction where the steamer was anchored. ‘Now,’ says I to myself, ‘what you’ve got to do, William, is to cut away back there and tell Mr. Dudley as quickly as you can. He’ll know what’s best to be done.’ ”
Dudley turned away, and began to walk quickly up and down. Despite the cook’s assurance, he did not know at all what to do. He could imagine all that had transpired on board the steamer, and he could very well picture the rage and mortification that filled the hearts of the Captain and Lampion when they discovered that their victim had been stolen from them. That Miss Erskine and Dudley were aware of the deadly plot which had been planned against the former, would be plain to them, and in that case, unless they wished exposure to follow, nothing remained for them but to make an effort, and, if possible, to seize the persons of the informers. For this reason they had put about immediately they had learnt what had transpired. They had searched the islands further along the coast without success, and were now making their way down in the hope of discovering or hearing something of the fugitives.
“ What am I to do ? ” groaned Dudley. “ What i99

can I do? The natives will be certain to inform them of their discovery of the boat on the beach, and they will search the island, and our capture will only be a question of time.”
It was, indeed, an awful position for a man to be placed in. He had taken upon himself the responsibility of Miss Erskine’s protection, and he was quite aware that, if these men succeeded in capturing them when they were so far removed from civilization, they would stick at nothing. What could he do ? The island, from what he had seen of it, was only a small one, and even if they were to hide themselves, it could not be very long before their presence would be discovered. Hunger, among other things, would drive them out To reach the mainland, or at least some of the adjacent islands, without a boat was impossible; while to secure one, now that their own had been taken from them, seemed equally out of the question.
“ I am thankful that you did not say anything about this before Miss Erskine,” Dudley said at last. “ It would have frightened her terribly, and it could have done no good.”
“ I thought of that, sir,” the man replied. “ The poor young lady has got enough on her mind at present without our adding to it. If you will allow me to say so, sir, I should keep the knowledge from her as long as possible.”
“ I shall do so, you need not be afraid,” retorted his companion. “ In the mean time we must not lose heart Please God, we shall be able to extricate her

from her troubles, though I must confess at present the future looks black indeed. I must think the position over at greater length, and see what is to be done. Have you managed to gather any idea where the principal town of the island is situated ? ”
“It must be somewhere along the east end, I should say,” Blake replied. “It stands to reason, sir, that it would be, or the steamer wouldn’t have anchored off that end. They have the charts aboard, and can see the lay of the country at a glance.”
Dudley was silent for a moment “ There’s something in what you say,” he answered. “Now the question for our consideration is, whether it would be better for us to hide until we can find an opportunity of getting away, or to go direct to the Sheik of the village and attempt to buy his influence and protection. Lampion and the Captain are not in a position to give very much, if they pay anything at all, while Miss Erskine and I are prepared to put up a very large sum. The Arab cannot run any possible risk, for the reason that if he accompanies us to Mombasa or Zanzibar, he can collect his money there and then. As far as I can see that is the best way out of the difficulty. What do you think ? ”
“I don’t see anything else for it,” the cook returned. “ But do you think, sir, you’ll be able to manage to talk him over ? ”
“ I can only do my best,” Dudley rejoined. “ I can try all the wiles I know, and leave the rest with Allah. In either case there is not very much to lose.

“ I thought of that, sir,” the man replied. * The poor young lady has got enough on her mind at present without our adding to it. If you will allow me to say so, sir, I should keep the knowledge from her as long as possible.”
“ I shall do so, you need not be afraid,” retorted his companion. “ In the mean time we must not lose heart Please God, we shall be able to extricate her

from her troubles, though I must confess at present the future looks black indeed. I must think the position over at greater length, and see what is to be done. Have you managed to gather any idea where the principal town of the island is situated ? ”
“It must be somewhere along the east end, I should say,” Blake replied. “It stands to reason, sir, that it would be, or the steamer wouldn’t have anchored off that end. They have the charts aboard, and can see the lay of the country at a glance.”
Dudley was silent for a moment “There’s something in what you say,” he answered. “Now the question for our consideration is, whether it would be better for us to hide until we can find an opportunity of getting away, or to go direct to the Sheik of the village and attempt to buy his influence and protection. Lampion and the Captain are not in a position to give very much, if they pay anything at all, while Miss Erskine and I are prepared to put up a very large sum. The Arab cannot run any possible risk, for the reason that if he accompanies us to Mombasa or Zanzibar, he can collect his money there and then. As far as I can see that is the best way out of the difficulty. What do you think ?”
“I don’t see anything else for it,” the cook returned. “ But do you think, sir, you’ll be able to manage to talk him over ? ”
“ I can only do my best,” Dudley rejoined. “ I can try all the wiles I know, and leave the rest with Allah. In either case there is not very much to lose.

If I knew where the village is situated I’d be off there at once.”
"And what about Miss Erskine, sir? How are you going to explain matters to her? She’d never forgive us if we didn’t tell her; and yet, as we said just now, to do so may be to frighten her nearly out of her senses.”
The other thought for a minute or so before he replied.
“ I have changed my mind,” he said at last " I think, all things considered, it would be the better plan to tell her everything. If we don’t, she will be sure to suspect, and then it may not only cause her pain, but may give rise to additional complications. Just take a stroll for a few minutes, there’s a good fellow, and leave me to explain matters to her.”
Blake did as he was requested, and Dudley approached the house.
“ Miss Erskine,” he began, when he reached the door, “ may I have a few moments’ conversation with you ? I have something of the utmost importance to report”
She emerged immediately. “I am here, Mr. Dudley,” she said. “Why do you ask if you may speak to me ? Who has so good a right ? What is it you want to say ? I am afraid you must have bad news, or your voice would not be so sad. If so, please tell me everything at once. I don’t think you will find me a coward.”
“ I am sure of that,” he answered. " I am afraid, however, that you will have to summon all your pluck

to your assistance, for we are in dreadful straits. The news I have to tell you is of the worst possible description. I have just learned from Blake that your uncle and the Captain have followed us.”
Courageous as she had determined to be, she could not suppress an exclamation of terror as she heard the news. But when she spoke again there was no trace of fear in her voice. She knew that if she gave way it would add to the difficulties of the man before her, and she was resolved that, happen what might, she would not hamper or harass him.
“ As you say, this is bad news indeed,” she said. “ But I am not afraid, Mr. Dudley. You have saved me before, and I feel sure that you will do so again. I am as convinced of that as that I stand upon this ground before you now. Please tell me what you propose to do ? ”
He repeated to her what he had said to Blake.
“ It is a very good plan, I think,” she answered, when he had finished. “ As for the money, I place all I have at your disposal. Promise the man whatever you like for his protection, and when we reach Mombasa or Zanzibar it shall be faithfully paid to him. When do you propose to go and see him ? ”
“I was thinking of going to-night,” Dudley replied ; * that is, provided I can find the whereabouts of the town. That there is a town I am convinced, and it is certain that it must boast a head man, who can be of assistance to us. In the mean time you must remain here with Blake, and I will return to you as soon as I have transacted my business.”

“ Go,” she answered quietly; * and may God bless your endeavours. Do not consider me at all. There are three lives to be thought of, and my fear is very small in comparison. Remember only that we shall be thinking of you and awaiting your return with all the anxiety in the world.”
Having told Miss Erskine, Dudley recalled Blake, and as soon as they had discovered a comfortable place they sat down to their evening meat It was not the happiest they had taken together by any means. The shadow of the new fear lay heavily upon them, and though Dudley tried his hardest to let it appear that he thought lightly of the danger, his efforts were unavailing. As soon as they had finished he rose to his feet
"Now I am going off to see what I can do to propitiate the Sheik of the village,” he said, with an attempt at cheerfulness he was far from feeling. “ You will promise me not to move away from here until my return ? ”
“We will give you our promise,” Miss Erskine replied. “But oh, Mr. Dudley, do not be longer than you can help. You know how anxious we shall be to see you again.”
“For my own sake,” Dudley answered, “you may be quite sure that I shall be as expeditious as possible.”
He took her hand and pressed it. “ Good-bye,” he said, “ and above all do not lose heart.”
“ Good-bye,” she replied, “ and may God in His mercy bless you.”

He held out his hand to Blake, who took it and returned the squeeze with interest
“Good-bye, sir,” he began. “Keep your eyes open, and don’t let those rascals get the best of you. Remember it’s for the young lady you are fighting.”
“ I shall bear that in mind,” the other responded ; and in a lower voice he added, “Take care of her, Blake, while I am away.”
Then he walked off, and the darkness, which was frought with so many mysteries for them all, swallowed him up.

CHAPTER XIII
As may be remembered, Dudley had been inclined on the previous evening to resent the appearance of the moon, for the reason that he was afraid the light might reveal to the officer of the watch his attempt to leave the steamer. To-night, however, his sorrow was, not that there was a moon, but that she did not rise until so late. He soon discovered, after leaving his party, that it was easier to talk of making his way to the east end of the island than actually to get there. In the shelter of the trees it was pitch dark, and in consequence he could scarcely see a yard before his face. More than once he caught his foot in some unseen obstacle and came near measuring his length upon the ground, and when he remembered that any accident to himself would in all probability bring ruin to his friends, his anxiety was increased rather than diminished. At last, however, the trees became thinner, and when he had been walking, or stumbling— for that perhaps would be a better way of expressing it—for more than an hour, he found himself looking upon the sea at the further end. How still and peaceful the scene was ! The stars were mirrored in the placid surface of the water like the reflection of a 206

city’s lamps in a smooth river, and he could even hear the lapping of the tiny waves upon the beach among the mangroves below. Lying well out from the shore he could discern the lights of the steamer, and, as he looked at her, he wondered whether Lampion and the Captain were on board. He trusted they were, for he had no desire to visit the village and be confronted with them. By appropriating the ship’s boat without permission he had placed himself in the Captain’s power, and he had not the smallest doubt but that the latter would be fully prepared to take advantage of the fact at the earliest possible opportunity. Having recovered his breath after his climb, he turned to the left, and made his way along the side of the hill in the hope of discovering the village. That it would be found there he had no doubt, nor was he wrong, for, after he had passed round the bend of the hill, he was brought face to face with a collection of white houses of the same description as those in the centre of the island. He knew that he must exercise all his caution; one false step would be fatal to the success of his enterprise. Little by little, like a thief in the night, he approached the cluster of buildings. It was a fairly large place, boasting per* haps as many as a hundred houses, which straggled irregularly along the foot of the hilL When he was within a short distance of the nearest house, he paused and took stock of his position. He wanted to discover the residence of the Chief, or head man, but in the dark that was rather a difficult matter. However, it had to be found, and, foreseeing that he

was likely to have a long interview before him when he reached it, he determined to set about it as quickly as possible. He had just made up his mind to approach the house nearest him in order to make inquiries, when voices burst upon his ear. Almost instinctively he sprang back into the shadow of the trees, and then, crouching amongst the bushes, waited to find out who the talkers were.
“Tell him again,” said some one in English; and as he heard it his heart seemed to leap into his mouth. It was the voice of his enemy, the Captain. “ Tell him that we know they are on the island, and that if he doesn’t find them by midday to-morrow, well give him such a warm time of it that he’ll wish he had died before he saw us. Don’t beat about the bush with him, Lampion; you’ll spoil everything if you da I only wish to goodness I could talk his lingo.”
“We must be diplomatic, my dear fellow,” returned Lampion, who was evidently the more sober of the two; “ it will do no good to get his back up. In that case he will turn obstinate, and do nothing to help us.” Then, turning to the Arab who had been walking beside him, he continued in Arabic, “My friend is desirous that these people shall be found to-morrow morning. If it be done he promises great reward. We know that they are here because their boat has been found by your people, and they can only have landed since midday, for the reason that it was but yesterday they left the ship. They are thieves and murderers, and you will do well to ao8

be rid of them. Moreover, they have a woman with them, who is of my house, and my honour is concerned.”
" I will see what can be done,” the Arab replied. (t If they are here they shall be found. I can say no more.”
"What is his answer?” inquired the Captain, suspiciously.
" He says that if they can be found they shall be,” Lampion replied. " Now, my idea is this.”
They were some considerable distance along the path by this time, so that it was not possible for Dudley to hear what Lampion’s idea was. That it would not be to his advantage he felt sure.
As soon as they were out of sight he rose to his feet once more.
“ Fate could not have played into my hands more kindly,” he said to himself. " What I have to do is to waylay that old rascal on his return from the beach, and put the question to him. Thank goodness I am armed, and, if he does not feel inclined to do what I wish with moral persuasion, I am afraid I must try to achieve my purpose in another fashion. It looks as if it is likely to be a pitched battle between us for his favour. Later on we shall see which of us carry the heavier guns.”
As he said this he made his way along the path in the direction that the others had followed. It was his intention, if possible, to have the matter out with the Chief, when he was at a safe distance from his own people. This, Dudley argued, was his only 209	p

A Sailor’s Bride
chance of arriving at a favourable conclusion of the matter.
Having descended the hill in the direction of the sea, as far as he deemed prudent, he seated himself on the butt of a mangrove tree, and awaited the Arab’s return. He was destined to have a longer vigil than he expected, for upwards of an hour elapsed before he heard the sound of a man ascending the path. As soon as he did so, however, he pulled himself together and prepared for battle. During his wait he had overhauled all that he was going to say to the other, and was in consequence quite ready with an argument In his own mind he entertained no doubt whatever that the other would agree to his proposal, seeing the advantages it offered; at the same time he was acquainted with the shiftiness of the Arab race, and for this reason was not inclined to place too much reliance in any promise the Chief might make.
The steps came closer to where he was seated, until he could plainly hear the fat man grunting and grumbling as he ascended the path. Then the other left the shelter of bushes and entered the little open space, where Dudley was waiting to receive him. He rose, and advanced to greet him.
“ Salaam I ” began Dudley, gravely; and then continued in Arabic, “ May the blessing of the Prophet be upon thee and thy house. I have travelled afar to have words with thee, O Chief; let us, therefore, rest awhile here and talk together.”
“And who art thou who wouldst talk with me in this

place ? ” the other inquired, when he had recovered from his surprise. “ What is thy errand with me, and why dost thou accost me in such a fashion ? Knowst thou that I am the Chief of this island ? ”
* I know that full well, O Chief,” Dudley replied, with the same air of respect mingled with firmness. “ And it is for this reason that I am here to speak with thee, face to face, and as man to man. Knowst thou who lam?”
M Knows the rain the earth it falls upon ? ” asked the Chief. " Thou art one of those of whom the men down yonder spoke to me. Thou art he who I am to deliver to them before the sun sets to-morrow. Is that not so?”
“ It is even so,” Dudley answered. * But it shall not be as thou sayest Those men are my enemies. They have sought to destroy the woman I love, and it is in their heart that they would kill me also. Now, O Sheik, wilt thou aid them in this evil ? We are strangers upon thy shores, and we crave thy protection. If thou wilt bestow it, great honour and reward shall be with thee, and also the respect of the White Queen, whom I serve. Help us so that we may reach Lamu safely, and anything thou mayest ask will be thine. I swear this upon the beard of my father and the honour of my name.”
He paused, and waited for the Arab to reply. It was an awkward moment, and Dudley has since told me that it seemed to him as if he could hear his own heart beating like the surf upon the reef half a mile away.

“ And what is it that thou wilt give, O Stranger ? ” the Chief inquired. “ Promises are like the winds of Heaven, here this minute, and gone the next It is in my power to save thee, and those with thee, but I must know the reward first”
Dudley saw that it was no time for half-measures. “ Thou hast only to name thy price,” he said, “ and it shall be granted thee. Hast thou a knowledge of English money ? ”
The Arab grunted.
“I have sailed to Zanzibar, and I know everything. I do not lie, and my beard is grey. How much wilt thou give me ? ”
“ Thou shalt have five hundred pounds of gold in English money if thou wilt land us safe and sound at the Administrator’s House in the Island of Lamu without delay. What dost thou say ? ”
The Arab pushed back his turban and proceeded to scratch his shaven crown.
“ It is a great risk, but if the money is good it can be done,” he said. “ But how am I to know that, when I have carried thee hither, thou wilt not play me false, and so I shall lose my reward ? ”
This was a poser, and Dudley scarcely saw how to overcome it He had no pledge to give to the Arab that, in the event of his carrying out his own portion of the compact, the other side would do the same.
“There is no way I can see of proving my honour,” he answered, “save that thou shouldst accompany us to Lamu. Nay, I will go further. If all does not fall out as I have said, I will pledge

myself to return with thee here. Think of five hundred pounds in English money. It is more than thou hast ever dreamed of. With it thou couldst buy many dhows and trade among the islands, and be the richest man upon this coast. Do I not serve the White Queen, and is it likely I should tell thee lies upon this matter, when my life and the lives of the others are at stake ? ”
“ And what of these others whom thou speakest of? What shall I answer them who come searching for thee ? ”
“Only that thou canst not find us,” Dudley replied. " It will not be difficult, for thou needst not look for us. Thou hast only to swear that we are not here, and they will believe thee, and so thou shalt earn the reward.”
“ I will think of it,” the Arab answered. “ In the mean time come thou with me to my house in order that I may see thy face, for at present thou art not known to me.”
Dudley rose as the other said this, and while he did so he fingered the revolver in his pocket Situated as he was, he could not very well make an excuse to get out of accompanying the Arab to the house, however dangerous or unnecessary the excursion might appear to him.
“ Lead on,” he said, “ and I will follow thee. But remember this, if there is any appearance of treachery thou wilt not get thy reward, and moreover, the ships of the White Queen will come here and exact the penalty.”

“ There is no treachery in my heart towards thee,” the Arab returned. “Why shouldst thou speak of such a thing to me ? ”
Then stalking on ahead, he led the way towards the village that Dudley had seen on the slope of the hill Strangely enough, when he reached it, the latter found himself standing before the very house at which he had thought of inquiring earlier that evening for the head man of the village.
Having entered, the Chief called loudly for a light, which was presently brought him by a slave. It consisted of a piece of fibre floating in a basin of oil, but its sickly gleam was sufficient to permit of Dudley’s taking stock of the man before him. He was of medium height, but very fat and corpulent, and, to add to his already sinister appearance, he was the possessor of a squint which would have discredited an even greater man. So far as Dudley could see, he did not appear to be the sort of person to whom one would be willing to entrust one’s safety, much less one’s life. However, like all Arabs, he was naturally avaricious, and it was upon this string that Dudley intended to play.
The lamp having been set upon the floor, the Chief seated himself upon an angareb at the further end of the room, and invited his guest to do the same. The latter complied with the request, but it was observable that he still kept his hand in his pocket as if to be ready in case of emergency. He had had to do with Coast Arabs before, and he was familiar with many of their little pleasantries.

“And where is thy party now, O Stranger?” the Arab inquired, when they had been seated for a few moments in silence.
Dudley had anticipated this question, and could see nothing for it but to give a truthful answer. Had he withheld their hiding-place, the Arab would have become suspicious, and then the advance he had made would have been, to all intents and purposes, useless. He accordingly informed him that they were encamped in a deserted village halfway down this island. After a little questioning the other seemed to recognize the spot, and, as far as could be gathered, he regarded it as a safe hiding-place.
“ Remain there until thou hearest from me,” he answered. “They that seek thee will not do so before midday, and, if all goes well, they may not do so at all. It is five hundred pounds in English money that I am to receive for carrying thee to Lamu ? Thou art certain of that ? ”
“Five hundred pounds English money is what I will give thee, provided thou doest act as I say,” Dudley replied; “ but if there is treachery, then beware, for thou wilt get nothing.”
“Manghobo, the son of Mwahini, is no traitor,” asserted the Arab, vigorously. “That which he promises he will fulfil; therefore let it be seen that others do likewise. And now farewell. I will find means to get thee away to-morrow. Till then lie hid ”
Seeing that nothing further could be gained by remaining, Dudley bade the Chief farewell, and took himself off; not, however, until he had once more 215

impressed upon the other the advantages that were to be derived from acting as he desired.
“I wonder if I have done right?” he said to himself, as he left the house and climbed the hill once more. G Let us hope that he will prove true to his bargain. If not, we are undone indeed.”
He had plenty to think of as he scrambled and pushed his way through the scrub on the way back to his friends. Fortunately for him the moon had risen, and the return journey was a somewhat more pleasant experience than the outward had been. He was not destined, however, to reach his quarters as soon as he expected. It may possibly have been that, in his anxiety concerning the arrangements he had made, he allowed his thoughts to wander from the matter in hand; at any rate, when he had been walking for upwards of an hour he could not but come to the conclusion that he had lost his way. He had searched this way and that, and when at last he did see the cluster of houses in front of him, he was perfectly worn out He felt as if he could not have walked another mile had his life depended upon it. Needless to say, his friends were eagerly awaiting his return. Miss Erskine came to meet him with both hands outstretched. Taking his in hers, she looked him in the face, and then, almost as if it were an afterthought, inquired what success he had met with. Before he answered, Dudley crossed the little space before the hut, and seated himself upon the trunk of the fallen tree, upon which he had awaited Blake’s return that evening.

“ I have seen the Chief,” he began,(t and though you may scarcely believe it, I have also seen the Captain and Doctor Lampion. They passed within a few paces of me, but fortunately they were not aware of my presence. The Chief I met afterwards, and accompanied him to his house.”
“ And what did he say ? ” inquired Miss Erskine, eagerly.
Dudley thereupon informed her of all that had passed between them, and of the arrangement they had come to.
“ Do you think he will play fairly by us ? ” she asked, when he had concluded his narrative.
•‘That I cannot say,” answered Dudley. “We must hope that the inducement we are holding out to him will be sufficient to make him do so. Unfortunately, however, he has no guarantee that our offer is a bond fide one. He entertains a doubt as to whether we will act up to our part of the bargain, even if he carries us to Lamu. The Captain and your uncle are in a somewhat different case. Their steamer is anchored off the island—a very tangible proof that they are what they pretend to be. However, we will talk of that in the morning. And now, Miss Erskine, I think it is time for you to retire to rest You must be worn out by all your exertions. Go in and lie down, remembering always that Blake and I are keeping watch at your door.”
With childlike obedience she did as he requested, pausing at the door to offer him her hand. He took it and raised it to his lips. At that moment he 217

would have given anything he possessed to be able to take her in his arms, and tell her how much she was to him, and how gladly he would give his own life to save her even an hour’s pain. But I think she knew that already.
When they settled themselves down for the night, it was questionable whether either of them slept very well. Dudley, it is certain, did not. All sorts of wild projects for saving the girl he loved flashed through his brain, and were discarded as unworkable. When day dawned he was as far off the solution of the difficulty as he had been at the beginning. So far as he could see, there was nothing for it but to trust to the Arab’s honesty to fulfil his promise.
On Miss Erskine making her appearance from the house next morning, Dudley guessed that she had some important news to communicate. Her face was smiling and her eyes sparkled.
"You said last night, I think,’’ she began, when they had wished each other good morning, " that as we have no ready money, it is impossible for us to offer any preliminary bribe to this Arab, in order to show our good faith and to induce him to take us to Lamu. I expect you will say that it is just like a woman to have thought of such a thing; but, before I left the steamer, I took the precaution of bringing away with me all that I valued most of my jewellery. At the present moment I have a diamond necklace round my neck, while my rings and bangles are hidden away in a safe place. Here is a bracelet. Why should you not give it to him ? ”
218

As she spoke she took from her pocket a beautiful diamond bracelet, and handed it to Dudley.
" It is, indeed, one way out of the difficulty,” the other replied, balancing the article in his hand, as if uncertain whether to take it. “I expect the old rascal’s eyes will twinkle when he sees it But are you quite sure that you feel disposed to let him have it ? ”
“I value our lives at more than a bracelet,” she answered with a smile. “ Please take it, Mr. Dudley, and remember that if you want anything else I have more to spare.”
Although Dudley had expected that the Arab would put in an appearance as soon as it was light, the morning was well advanced before they saw anything of him. When he did come, it was not from the direction of his own village, but from the opposite end of the island. This time he was accompanied by another man of scarcely more prepossessing appearance than himself.
“Peace be with you,” was his greeting, as he approached the house. “I have been looking for thee since the rising of the sun. They from the ship have been to me again, and are even now searching for thee over yonder. Had it not been for the tales I told them, thou wouldst have been taken long since.”
Whether his assertion was true or not, Dudley did not pause to inquire. He thanked the man for his assistance, and once more promised him a large reward if he would convey them as far as Lamu.

“ I have thought of that,” said the Arab, * and for the money of which thou spoke to me last night it might be done. But how am I to know that thou art rich enough to pay this large sum ? Moreover, it will cost much money for the boat”
In reply Dudley took him a little on one side, and showed him the bracelet Miss Erskine had furnished him with. A hungry look came into the Arab’s face, and Dudley noticed that his companion watched his proceedings with avaricious eyes.
#< And what is this thing ? ” the Chief inquired, after he had handled it for a moment and watched the sunlight play upon the stones.
“ It is a present to thee, O Chief,” Dudley replied. “ Let it prove to thee that, when we say we will give thee five hundred pounds of English money to take us to this island, we are able to pay it That alone is worth more than one hundred pieces of English gold.” •
The Chief shook his head, as if that were a statement he was not quite able to swallow. However, he was careful to put it away in a safe place, and to be sure that his companion did not see him do it Then he turned to Dudley again.
"It shall be even as you say,” he answered. “When the time is ready I will take thee and thy party to Lamu. There thou shalt speak well of me to the Governor, and shalt be sure to pay me as thou hast promised.”
“Thou shalt receive thy money,” Dudley replied. “And when will we be able to start?”
220

To this question the Chief protested that at the moment he could not tell. "There is much to be done first, and those of the ship must be made to understand that thou art no longer on the island. This will take me much time.” Then he added, with meaning, “ And it may be another present”
Then, promising to communicate with them again, he took his departure with his companion, bidding them at the same time lie closely hid; for, as he remarked, if any of his people should chance to see them, there would be the danger of their carrying the news to the ship.
After he had gone, the three outcasts took counsel together. Miss Erskine, who had watched the proceedings from the house, had come to the conclusion that she did not trust the Arab.
" I’m with you there, miss,” said Blake. “ I don’t like the cut of his jib a little bit. What do you say, sir ? ”
“ Like you, I am doubtful as to whether he is to be trusted,” Dudley answered. “That reference to another present makes me feel uncomfortable. However, I’m afraid we’re in his power, and I don’t see any other means of escape. If only the steamer would take her departure, I expect he would carry us to Lamu in a few hours.”
“Excuse me, sir,” continued Blake, “but I have been turning something over in my mind. It’s only a bit of an idea like; but it seems to me that it might be managed. How would it be, sir, if we could find out where our boat is, get her back from the

natives, and set sail in her again, hoping to pick up this here Lamu before we’d been very long at sea ? ”
He looked anxiously at Dudley, to see with what favour his plan would be received.
" It would be all very well if we could get hold of the boat,” the latter replied. “I thought of it myself in the night,’but in all probability she has been taken back to the steamer. They would be scarcely likely to allow her to remain on shore. We might try and get hold of one of their own craft, but it would be running a big risk, and I am afraid for the present we are not in a position to do that No; until we find the Chief out in any duplicity, I fear we must be content to trust him.”
To add to their discomfort, the midday meal proved to be the last of the food they had brought from the steamer. Unless they were prepared to starve, it would be necessary for them to obtain a fresh supply.
“In that case,” said Dudley, “I am afraid there is nothing for it but for me to pay another visit to the Chiefs house. He must furnish us with provisions sufficient to last us until we can get away. I’ll be off* as soon as it grows dark.”
True to his word, as soon as dusk fell, he departed on his errand. This time he was more acquainted with the road, and, as he had started earlier than on the previous occasion, he was able to make better progress. Long before he reached the town, however, it had grown dark enough to afford him the

protection he wanted. He had mapped out his interview with the Arab, and had thought of a scheme which he fancied might be of some service. As he approached the first building, and was wondering in what manner he could make sure that Lampion and the Captain were not on shore, he received a fright that he is likely to remember for years to come. The place was darker than usual at that point, and he was not, perhaps, paying so much attention as he should have done to the route; at any rate, he suddenly found himself confronted by a man.
“Be silent,” whispered the new-comer. “I have been looking for thee, but missed thee in the dark. Had it not been for my haste, thou wouldst have been a prisoner ere this.”
“Who art thou?” Dudley inquired in Arabic.
“And what dost thou want with me?”
“I am he who accompanied Manghobo to the place where thou art hidden. There is treachery toward. Let me speak to thee in a private place.”
So saying, he led Dudley along the path, and, when they were at some distance from the town, stopped and spoke to him.
“ Listen thou,” he began, “ I am Segbani, cousin of Manghobo, and I speak true talk. Thou hast promised my cousin that he shall receive five hundred pounds of English money, if he will take thee to Lamu safely. Now, hearken, for there is much that thou shouldst hear. To-night those of the ship are with him. They are angered, inasmuch as he has not yet given thee into their hands. Now, to make

it sure that he shall not play false with them, they have taken his only son and put him on their ship, swearing that they will kill him when darkness falls to-morrow, if he has not already delivered thee and thy companions up to them. Now, Manghobo loves his son with a greater love even than his riches, and it is in his heart to act in this way. He will come to thee early in the morning and ask for yet greater reward. Having received it, he will tell thee that he has a dhow waiting to take thee away. When sail is set he will carry thee, and those who are with thee away, but not to Lamu. He will take thee to another island, where it is arranged he shall slay all thy party, and so get his reward, and his son go free. That is true talk, as thou wilt find if thou puttest thy trust in Manghobo.”
For a moment Dudley did not know what to do. “I felt sure the old villain was playing a double game,” he said to himself at last, in English. “ The treacherous hound; but I’ll be even with him yet Now, I wonder what this fellow’s little game can be ? He is evidently acting against his cousin, and his avarice is urging him to try and get the reward for himself.”
“ I have heard what thou hast said,” he continued in Arabic, “ and have pondered it well. Now, what canst thou do to save us ? Canst thou bring us to Lamu thyself? If so, the reward I promised Manghobo shall be paid to thee. Speak what is in thy mind, and let there be no treachery.”
“ I am a true man,” the other answered. “From 224

the first my heart inclined towards thee. I will do as thou sayest Let there first be given me, moreover, such a thing as thou didst give to my cousin this morning.”
“ When we are once safely on the water,” Dudley replied, “then thou shalt have even better than was given thy cousin this morning. Where is thy dhow ? ”
“ In yonder bay,” the other answered, pointing to the harbour on the further side of the town. “ She is a good boat, and will carry thee to Lamu with the swiftness of a bird.”
“ And where wilt thou take us aboard ? ” he inquired. “ It would not be safe to come here.”
“ There is the bay that is near thy hiding-place,” the other remarked. “ There it is deep water, and it is also behind the island on the channel leading to Lamu. Is it agreed that ye go ? ”
* It is agreed,” said Dudley, solemnly. “ And now there is another thing that thou must do. Go to thy house, and bring me again food sufficient to last a day. Be silent, and I will reward thee for that also.”
“Wait here,” answered the man, “and I will come again quickly.”
He disappeared into the darkness, and Dudley sat down to wait A desperate plan had suddenly formed itself in his mind, and he was going to carry it out at any hazard. If what the man had told him were true, it was manifestly unsafe for them to remain any longer upon the island. They must get away

before daylight, and before the crafty Chief could suspect their intention.
In something less than a quarter of an hour the Arab returned, carrying a bag of provisions in his hand.
“ See, here is food enough for six men,” he began. “Now bestow upon me the reward.”
Dudley drew his hand from his pocket, and it contained, not a bracelet, but a revolver.
“ My friend,” he said very quietly, but distinctly, “ before I bestow the reward upon thee I must have more service. It has occurred to me that this island is not safe to dwell upon. It is my will, therefore, that we should leave it at once. Rest thy eyes upon my hand, and thou shalt see I have in it that with which I can end thy life, upon the bending of a finger. Make no sound, but lead me to the dhow of which thou didst speak just now. We will set sail in her at once, and so shalt thou earn thy money when we reach Lamu.”
The man was prepared to expostulate, but Dudley bade him hold his peace.
“ This is no time to talk,” he said. “ Pick up that bag and lead the way. Remember, if thou dost betray me thy life pays forfeit.”
They stood face to face, looking at each other in silence for upwards of a minute. Then the Arab, seeing that the other held the stronger hand, and, being a philosopher as well as a rogue, answered quietly—
“ Be it so. I submit But let it be seen that thou payest me the reward in the end.”

Realizing that there was nothing else for it, he passed the town and led the way to the beach. Here they found the dhow of which the Arab had spoken so highly. They boarded her, and Dudley bade the man cast her loose.
" We will start at once,” he said.
But the other demurred. " It is not possible,” he cried. “I do not know the way, and there is no wind.”
"Thou canst find the way in the dark,” Dudley retorted sternly, “ and there is wind enough. Let us sail for the little bay which is near the house where my friends lay hidden, without more talk. Be faithful, and thou shalt be the richest man along the coast; take me into a trap, and thou diest at that moment”
Seeing that there was nothing for it but to obey, the man cast the dhow off, and a few minutes later they were drawing across the harbour.
“ If only our luck holds, we are safe;” said Dudley to himself, rapturously. “ I ought to consider myself fortunate. If I had not met this man to-night, we should certainly have believed that rascal’s statements, and in that case nothing could have prevented us from being murdered. Lampion is, indeed, a villain of the first water.”
They had been sailing for upwards of an hour when Segbani, from whom Dudley never allowed his eyes to wander, put the vessel on another tack, and entered a small indentation in the coast that could scarcely be dignified by the name of a bay.

“ It is here that thy friends lie hidden,” he said sullenly. “ Wilt thou go ashore and call them ? ”
“ Even so,” Dudley answered. “ And thou shalt come with me.”
The Arab gave a grunt of disapproval, but seeing that it was hopeless to resist, he brought his craft alongside a projecting slab of rock, which served as a jetty. To secure her it was necessary that he should land, but, as a matter of precaution, Dudley accompanied him. After that had been done, they set out, in the same order that they had adopted in making their way to the dhow, in search of the house where he knew Miss Erskine and Blake were so anxiously awaiting him. They were surprised to find that he was accompanied by an Arab, but feeling sure that he had good reason for it, they offered no remark at the time.
“Blake, my good fellow,” he said, “just get Miss Erskine’s things out of the house at once, will you ? Our chance has come, and we must be off without loss of time. This worthy gentleman is going to carry us to Lamu. Miss Erskine, may I trouble you to assist Blake ? I would do so myself, but I must watch our friend here. He is as slippery as an eel.”
In less time than it takes to tell, they had collected their belongings, and were marching back to the dhow. To board her and to cast her off occupied scarcely more time than it takes to tell, and in something less than a quarter of an hour they were en route for Lamu. As soon as they had settled 338

down on board, Dudley described the adventures he had met with that evening.
M When daylight comes a stronger breeze should get up,” he said, after he had finished his narrative. “ Then we shall make better progress. Please God we shall be thirty miles from the island before Man-ghobo turns out to look for us. I shall always regret that I did not put a bullet into his old body before we said good-bye to him.”
“No, no,” Miss Erskine returned gently. *Let him go. Badly as he has treated us, there are others even more to blame.”
Turning to Segbani, who was steering, Dudley asked him how far the island was from Lamu.
“ A day’s sail, with a good wind,” the other replied, and then relapsed into silence once more.
When the sun rose a fair breeze came with him, as Dudley had predicted. The dhow sped merrily before it; hour after hour slipped by, until at last they found themselves abreast of a larger island than they had yet seen. They were still in the channel that separated them from the mainland, but what the name of that channel was Dudley did not know, nor could Segbani enlighten him. It was gradually widening, however, and presently on turning a corner a fair-sized town came into view.
It was situated on a slight eminence, and to their eyes, after all they had been through, it looked as imposing as Zanzibar itself.
“ We are saved! we are saved 1 ” Dudley cried, turning to Miss Erskine, and seizing her hand. “Thank 229

God, you are delivered from your enemies at last!”
Blake, who had been forward, came aft to add his congratulations to theirs. They were unheard, however, for Dudley, after his last speech, had fallen in a dead faint at Miss Erskine’s feet His anxiety and the strain of the last few weeks had proved too much for him.
When he recovered consciousness, he found Miss Erskine and Blake kneeling beside him. The former’s face was very pale.
“ Be brave, miss, be brave,” Blake was saying as Dudley opened his eyes. “ He’ll be all right soon. See, he is coming-to now. How do you feel, sir ? ”
“ Better, much better,” Dudley answered. “ I cannot think what made me go off like that I’m as bad as an hysterical schoolgirl.”
He rose to his feet to find that they were approaching the town. In less than five minutes, if all went well, they would be ashore.
“ Can you believe that you are really safe ? ” he asked in an undertone of the girl beside him.
Her eyes filled with tears. “ Scarcely,” she replied, looking at the buildings ashore. “Oh, Mr. Dudley, what a debt of gratitude I owe you. How can I ever repay you for all you have done for me?” Her voice trembled, and Dudley saw that she was on the verge of tears.
“ Mary,” he said very softly, taking her hands in his, “ I will tell you how you can repay me. I have loved you from the first moment I saw you. I felt 330

then that you were my fate. Providence has given me an opportunity of showing you the quality of my love. If you love me there is a way you can repay me, and that is by consenting to become my wife.”
UI do love you,” she answered simply; “ and if you will have me I will gladly be your wife.”
Whether there was anything more that should have been said I do not know; if so, neither of them said it They were content to stand hand in hand, thinking their own thoughts, and watching the dhow draw nearer to the shore. In the first glow of their happiness the bitter past was forgotten. As the palmist had said in Cape Town, u their love had not been all smooth sailing;" but what did that matter, since they were to be happy at the end? After a while Blake once more came aft and stood beside them.
“ Blake,” said Dudley, “ we owe our safety to you. But for your assistance on board the steamer we should never have been so successful. You have been a good and true friend to us, and, come what may, you shall never regret it. Give me your hand.”
The two shook hands; and then Miss Erskine held out hers to the cook.
“ God bless you I and I thank you with all my heart,” she said.
For some reason the honest fellow was compelled to turn his face away.
Ten minutes later they were ashore and on their way to the Administrator's residence, closely followed

by Segbani, who, in his turn, was not going to lose sight of them for a moment
It was, indeed, a curious tale they had to pour into the Administrator’s ears. During his residence on the island he had heard many strange stories, and from all sorts of men, but never one like this.
“ My dear young lady,” he said, addressing Miss Erskine, “you have indeed had a terrible experience. But let us thank Providence that you have come so safely out of it Mr. Dudley, Admiral Redfurn will be glad indeed to hear of your safety; he believes you to be dead. I congratulate you most heartily upon the courage you have shown ; you deserve your good fortune if ever a man did. With regard to the adventure with Manghobo, I wonder that you escaped as easily as you did. I know the old rascal well, and the reputation he bears is by no means a good one. I shall not fail to talk to him next time I see him, and let him understand very plainly what I think of his treatment of you. As for Segbani, if you will leave him in my hands, I think I can promise you that he will be content with a much smaller reward than you have offered him.”
“No, sir,” Dudley replied earnestly, “I cannot consent to that The man, with your permission, must receive what I promised him. When you consider that he saved our lives, it is not very much to give him in return.”
Then followed some business talk as to the arrangement for the payment of the money to the Arab. This settled, the Administrator invited Miss 33a

Erskine to follow him in order that she might be presented to his wife, who, he felt sure, would attend to her comfort
“ Perhaps you will wait here for a few moments,” he said to Dudley, as they were leaving the room. “ I shall not be very long.”
With that he departed accompanied by Miss Erskine, and Dudley was left to his own devices. He had not been alone very long, however, before he heard some one enter the Administrator’s public office, which was in the adjoining apartment
“Is Mr. Burling in?” inquired the new-comer; and as Dudley heard the voice he sprang to his feet
He would have recognized it among a thousand. A moment later he was shaking the other wildly by the hand, crying—
“ Bradford I Bradford I what on earth does this mean ? ”
It was the Torpedo-lieutenant of his own ship 1
It might be said with truth that if Dudley seemed astonished, the other was even more so.
“Duddy, old man,” he cried, shaking his hand, “is it you or your ghost? What does it mean? How do you happen to be here? Do you know we have searched this side of Africa for you ? And the Admiral has been mourning you as he would his own son. Where have you been? Why are you here? And—well, come along, sit yourself down and tell me all about it”

narrated to him, and the reception the hero of it received from the entire ship’s company of the Coriolanus when he went on board that afternoon, I must leave you to imagine for yourselves.
“ I have never forgiven myself for having sent you on that foolish errand in search of Achmet ben Hassein,” said the Admiral to his junior, when they were closeted together in the former’s cabin. “I had quite given you up for lost, but, God be thanked 1 you have turned up again safe and sound. It is, indeed, fortunate that we happen to be here just now. But for certain little complications that have arisen, and with which you will be made acquainted in due course, we should have been in Zanzibar to-day. And so you are really engaged to Miss Erskine, the beauty and the millionairess? Well, you have fought hard for her; I congratulate you most heartily; God bless you, my boy.”

It would take too long for me to tell you how, on the same afternoon, the man-o’-war made her way up the coast in search of the steamer that had played such a prominent part in Miss Erskine’s and Dudley’s drama. Needless to say they did not find her. The departure of Segbani with his dhow, when they came to hear of it, must have convinced them that their prey had once more slipped through their fingers. Realizing that to follow them to Lamu would be as useless as it would be dangerous, they had doubtless put the steamer about, and continued their voyage to Aden. Inquiries made at the latter

place elicited the information that Lampion had left the ship at that port, and had disappeared, no one knew whither. The Captain relinquished his command at Port Said and had not been heard of since. As for Segbani, he received his reward, but has not returned to the island. He has taken up his abode at Mombasa, and considers it better suited to his health.
A fortnight later Dudley and Miss Erskine were married at the English Church in Zanzibar. The Admiral gave the bride away; Bradford attended the bridegroom as best man ; Blake smiled approval upon every one, and himself in particular, and as the young couple, still accompanied by their faithful servant (he is now a well-to-do confectioner in a country town hard by Dudley’s country seat), steamed out of harbour next morning in the mail-boat, bound for the South, the entire ship’s company of the flagship threw discipline to the winds, and cheered them so long as they remained in hearing and they had breath to do it Dudley has left the Service now. He still takes the greatest interest in things naval, however, and in that he is encouraged by his wife, who is often heard to declare that she knows as much about the sea as most girls.
“It seems to me I should,” she continues; “for was it not at sea, and under the most terrible circumstances, that my husband and I learnt to love each other? Consequently I have every right to call myself a ‘ Sailor’s Bride i ’ ”
